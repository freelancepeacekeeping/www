<h1>Micromasters Turn Strategy</h1>
<h3>2019.XY.XY</h3>


<h2>Strategy 1: Taking it in turns…</h2>
<p>The simplest strategy to play with the Micromasters is that the patrol partner blocks the first few hits, and then each member of the patrol presents themselves to take a hit, ending in the effective patrol leader. In this strategy, the number of hits the partner can take is their primary value. Due to Stealth is largely irrespective of who goes first, assuming the partner doesn't have a glass jaw leading to an easy K.O; thus we'll use the term Turn-Pair to describe each player playing a turn. </p>
<p>The strategy will depend on the delta in wideness between the teams. It is critical that, after the partner is K.O.'d that a patrol member is flipped to protect the effective patrol leader. </p>
<p>Let's assume this is a 5-wide Patrol taking on a 3-wide Patrol; let's assume a best case of the partner taking 3 hits, let's assume a worst case that the patrol are being taken out in a single hit, and let's assume the 3-wide goes first.</p>
<p>Round 1 (5 members):</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Partner takes hit and attacks.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 2: Partner takes hit. Patrol-1 attacks.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 3: Partner takes KO hit. Patrol-2 attacks.</li>
<li>Extra Attack 3: Patrol-3 taps or flip/attacks; then Patrol-Leader attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Round 2 (4 members; needs to be an only 2-wide opponent):</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Patrol-3 is K.O.'d. Patrol-1 attacks.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 2: Patrol-1 is K.O.'d. Patrol-2 flip/attacks.</li>
<li>Extra Attack 2: Patrol-Leader attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Round 3 (2 members; hopefully only 1-wide opponent):</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Patrol-2 K.O.'d. Patrol-Leader attacks in vengeance mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this strategy the patrol land 7 hits, with another hit from the partner. If we're looking at the Air Strike Patrol, who on average might hit for 6–7 attack damage, that could result in some 48–56 attack damage. Given a typical health total in the mid-30s, that delta of ~15 allows for victory if the opponent is getting ~2 defence each time. That's decent odds against an Aggro opponent for the Air Strike Patrol. </p>
<p>Crucial components to this:</p>
<p>Anything that protects a patrol member from a K.O. For example, Emergency Defense Field is a great roll of the dice here. You expect your patrol members to be K.O.'d, so putting an EDF on a patrol member is a good way to waste an opponents attack. Force Field is another great inclusion here if your patrol members have enough health (i.e. less useful for the low health Battle Patrol). </p>
<p>Partners who can block better help best. Insecticon Skrapnel is huge. Perhaps Demolisher is another who could be huge. </p>
<p>Repeating as it's crucial - if your patrol members are 1-hittable (i.e. an Aggro/well-armed opponent), you must protect your effective team leader. Lose them early and the game is as good as over.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that in both this strategy, and the strategy below, that, assuming your patrol members can do damage attacking, you are likely to only tap-ability once in the game. </p>
<h2>Strategy 2: Partner boosts the patrol</h2>
<p>The second strategy with Micromasters is to add a partner who boosts the patrol. The deck is still a Micromaster deck; it's built around the Micromasters and the partner is there to help them, not the other way around. Someone like Flamewar (Tough-1 for all) or General Optimus Prime (Bold-1/Tough-1 for all). In this case the partner wants to be somewhat protected. They will need to be able to take a first hit, but then the patrol would act as blockers. </p>
<p>Assuming again a 5 vs 3, opponent goes first, Micromasters K.O.'able:</p>
<p>Round 1 (5 members):</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Partner takes hit. Patrol-1 attacks.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 2: Patrol-1 is K.O.'d. Patrol-2 attacks.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 3: Patrol-2 is K.O.'d. Patrol-Leader attacks.</li>
<li>Extra Attack 3: Patrol-3 taps or flip/attacks; then Partner  attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Round 2 (3 members; needs to be an only 2-wide opponent):</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Partner K.O'd. Patrol-Leader flip/attacks with +2-level vengeance mode.</li>
<li>Turn-Pair 2: Patrol-Leader takes hit. Patrol-Leader flips; Patrol-3 attacks. </li>
</ul>

<p>Round 3 (2 members; hopefully only 1-wide opponent):</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-Pair 1: Patrol-3 K.O.'d. Patrol-Leader attacks in +3-level vengeance mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategy 3: Protect the Partner</h2>
<p>The third strategy with the Micromasters is to add a partner who is inherently valuable in themselves. Again the partner has to be able to take a first hit, and then the patrol act as blockers. The deck becomes a partner deck, not a Micromaster deck. It's unlikely the Micromasters will get much done if the deck is more planned around the partner deck, and you have to ask if the Micromasters are the best blockers. In this case, the deck is less likely to be a patrol deck and more likely to be individual Micromasters chosen for the value of their individual tap abilities.</p>
