<h1>Why Transformers TCG Rocks</h1>
<h3>2019.XY.XY</h3>


<p>This summer I learned to play four trading card games (TCGs). I learned Pokemon, Yugioh, Magic, and Transformers. Of these Transformers is the one that really caught my attention.</p>
<p>There are some soft reasons for why. I was a Transformers comic reader as a kid so I've a lot of history and lore already imbibed. It's also early in its release cycle, so it feels fresher than the others. That said, I also played Pokemon video games and read Fantasy books through said youth, so there's no reason why one of the other games couldn't have taken hold with me. Also, while Transformers feels fresher, it also lacks the "everyone is playing it" that Magic and Pokemon has.</p>
<p>It could also be that casual games of Pokemon, Yugioh and Magic all seem to result in trying to summon one of your powerful cards so you can crap on your opponent to stop them summoning one of their powerful cards. With Transformers, your core powers are automatically summoned and you can focus on the real job of getting rid of them.</p>
<p>However, reflecting on the game after a few months of playing, I feel the core reason why it's caught my attention is the little pips in the corner of the battle card. They are, I must admit, fairly innocuous. They are easily surpassed by the artwork of the card and the effect the card gives to one of my characters. Until that is you are in a battle between two bots and hoping that your next flip will be the blue/orange/white you need. Or you draw Handheld Blaster and start trying to figure out how to get rid of it again because those double blue pips are crying out to get back in your deck where they belong. Then the pips are screaming at you for attention. </p>
<p>It's then that you notice the first clever thing about the game (and I have no idea if it was borrowed from elsewhere, I'm happy to fanboy-in-ignorance). By overlapping the cards you want to play with the pips you need to battle with, the game creates a resource constraint without your needing to manage your own lands, or energies, or tributable-monsters. </p>
<p>If you spend more time looking at the available battle cards in the various waves, you notice the second clever thing the game designers do. They intentionally cause you pain by forcing you to make trade offs. Want a great attacking card? Chances are they gave it a defensive blue pip. Want super armor? Good luck, it's probably an orange pip. In addition to the resource constraint of pip vs effect, you now have to deal with the need to make trade-offs between the pips you want and the effects that will help them. This really ups the complexity of deck-building that you can choose to get into, while still allowing for very simple deck-building if you choose not to.</p>
<p>Transformers also notably doesn't let you go hunting in your deck. You can, in some situations peek at the top card, and you can, in some situations, hunt for a card in your scrap pile, but by and large </p>
<p>There would be one way to work around this: Have a really big deck (and Transformers doesn't, as far as I know, have a limit to the size of the deck). Then you would go unting through your deck for the  and then go hunting through your deck.</p>
<p>Except they don't let you do that. There are no cards that let you hunt your deck, and it seems very unlikely there ever will be, bar some teasing around the top card of the deck in certain situations. </p>
<p>You can dig through your scrap pile in some situations, and this might be the tactic that will eventually drive them to retire earlier waves so that the population of valuable cards for a type of deck isn't so high that you can create a scrap pile that never needs to be reshuffled into your deck.</p>
