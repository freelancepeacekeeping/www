<img src='BLAST OFF.png' title="Spaceships are weird tribes. By W2, it was pretty basic and at best had card draw as a theme. Over time they effectively were some form of simple rule cheat - draw card, play card, untap buddy.

I have chosen to preview battlefield scan on his alt mode. This would be too powerful for his bot mode, but in combiner vs combiner it would be an interesting play, perhaps via Escape Route, and it would be of mild interest for other decks. We want to encourage players to flip to attack, so in Bot mode we give him some greater attack; while keeping him vanilla there a la alt-Air Raid."/>
<img src='BRAWL.png' title="The alt mode is a form of Off-Road and Alpha Bravo; a ranged tank hitting slow trucks is a good fit. The bot mode is a W2 Fling. Making it a Fling stops it being a Turn 1 de-Safeguard.

Thematically though, he wants strength and armor. This suggests a low health."/>
<img src='SWINDLE.png' title="Extra Upgrade play per the Swindled battle card. The bot mode is kept limited to Combaticons, whereas the alt mode is a limited Swindled. To avoid him being too shallow, we give him Bold 1 in bot mode in line with the artwork's "in your face"-ness."/>
<img src='VORTEX.png' title="Definitely getting Pierce, a la Alpha Bravo. In alt mode, he flies fast so a more Bolder attack makes sense. Bold 1 is a simple one, but could make it more interesting flip-effect wise."/>
<img src='ONSLAUGHT.png' title="Variant of Scrounge for alt mode; pairs with Hot Spot.
The bot mode is where the team's Brave appears, and encourages the team to attack more. It pairs with Hot Spot again, and previews the Patrols. "/>
<img src='MILITARY FORMATION.png' title="Simpler version of Onslaught."/>
<img src='COMBATICON ENIGMA.png' title="More encouraging of attack; and a bit of a Thundercracker moment encouraging Brainstorms (curse their blueness). But oh those Focus Fires with Brainstorm."/>
<img src='BRUTICUS.png' title="Again, inverting Defensor. Also slowing the game down; which may be too much of a feel-bad.

WOTC used health between 32 and 39 for Combiners; Decepticons tending to be lower to go with their more aggressive abilities. Let us target 34.

Going with Melee and Ranged to give him something different. He's an idiot though, so we will give him his Heli Pierce, but rather than Bold or Tough, he self-immolates."/>
<br/><br/><hr/>
<img src='BLADES.png' title="All the TF Helicopters are nutcases. Again, for character bio, we need to go pierce here and we have a close quarters Heli character.

Unlike those two, we have him pierce in alt rather than bot mode to better fit the artwork, and to play differently. In bot mode we give him a Whirl like effect.

"/>
<img src='FIRST AID.png' title="No First Aid picture :(

We want First Aid to do some repairing. He's the inverse of Sky Dive here, and previews Hold the Line. In Truck mode we keep it simple to protect him."/>
<img src='GROOVE.png' title="Motorcycles are white pipped focused in the early waves [Chromia] and supporters [Flamewar/Arcee-alt], and generally did not work out too well. Groove would have been kept non-Protectobot in style as WOTC would have been looking to add more motorcycle options. We preview the Rescue Patrol here.

In bot mode we want to keep the white pip going; but we want to keep things simple. We will invert the alt mode.

No Groove picture :("/>
<img src='STREETWISE.png' title="Streetwise the character is all about noticing things; so he's a natural theme for Focus. In alt mode we go with a Bold 1 in line with his artwork; though it is very tempting to go with a more 'when you flip [W] you can replace' type approach, a la Recon System. That card has some timing complexity, so whereas I think WOTC might have included it, after W2 they had learned a lesson."/>
<img src='HOT SPOT.png' title="Variant of Scrounge for alt mode; pairs with Onslaught.
The bot mode is where the team's Brave appears, and encourages the team to defend more. It pairs with Onslaught again, and previews the Patrols."/>
<img src='PROTECT AND SERVE.png' title="Simlper version of Defensor."/>
<img src='PROTECTOBOT ENIGMA.png' title="Scrapping to repair is a smaller Salvage, and encourages playing another upgrade to repair again."/>
<img src='DEFENSOR.png' title="This resets a lot of the game; which may be too much for a repair deck. It also removes the Protectobots utility though. However; it's Salvage for Parts from Wave 1, so not a new thing to WOTC at this stage of 'aroundabouts W2'.

WOTC used 32->39 for Combiner health, but let's keep this low due to his repairing. Let's target 33.

We give him Bold to punish the Blue decks a little, and to cue up Blue-Black in a later wave."/>
