<p>Introducing the New Stars of the Common Game. </p>

<p>One of the more popular alternative formats for TFTCG is Junkion; in which players can only use Common cards. Common cards are solid, but they tend to lack synergies which means that Junkion decks lack the sudden game winners of a typical constructed deck. On the plus side, negative playing experiences are less, and Common cards are easy for everyone to get. </p>

<p>One of the primary issues in Junkion is maximising your star count. It can be quite the juggle to make sure you get a full team of 25 stars; with no star cards available, you're wasting potential value if you build a team of only 22 or 23 stars. </p>

<p>Fixing this was an early stated goal for the Alpha Trion Protocols for Set 2: <b>Make some Junkion star cards</b>.</p>

<p>After dabbling with thoughts for Actions, it was decided to go with Upgrades; there are a lot of powerful Actions in Junkion. </p>

<p>The first thing the Upgrades get is a pair of double-pips. Star cards are expensive, so there had better be some good value in them, and most of the star cards in the game have at least two battle icons. In this case, the Armor gains two Orange battle icons, while the Weapon gaines two Blue battle icons. </p>

</figure>

<p>Our Armor here is designed for the Aggro deck. Two Orange battle icons for more powerful battle flips, a +1 DEF to keep in the game, and a Bold-1 to boost those attacks. </p>

<p>The Weapon on the other hand is designed more for the Blue deck. It gets a Primary Laser +2 Attack, and, to stay in the game, a Tough-1. While Pierce is still a threat in Junkion, it's not the constant deluge that it can be in the typical Constructed game. </p>

<p>Lastly, let's add that little bit more. </p>

<p>The Armor gains Brave. This can feel like a limitation to the card, you are drawing attacks to your upgraded character; but it's important to remember that in an Aggro deck the Bullseye Aegis is not the best card you will play. The +1 DEF ups your survivability by 1, and the Bold-1 is nice, but what this will mostly do is draw the attack away from your more important attacker. This Armor is designed to end up in your scrap pile. </p>

<p>Hands-Free Artillery on the other hand gains Pierce-1. This gives the Blue Deck a touch more, with that little feel of Warpath's Pierce-2 in Bot-Mode, as shown on the card itself. </p>

<p>These two star cards are set to be mainstays of the Alpha Trion Junkion scene. I look forward to seeing them both in a mixed deck. </p>
