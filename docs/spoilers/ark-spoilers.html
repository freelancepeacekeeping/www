<p>Let's look at three cards from The Ark, a collective of custom card creators. Specifically, we're going to look at a stratagem from Blues on Attack's Adam Paris, a stratagem from Power by Primus' Jamie Maddison and Wreck 'n Rule's Joe Baiocchi; and an action from Blues on Attack's Dan Collett. </p>

<p>First up we have <b>Mayhem</b> - a stratagem for Ruckus that turns him for a boring vanilla expensive car into the oversized love child of <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/private-red-alert-medical-medic-WCS">Private Red Alert</a> and Wave 1's <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/prowl-military-strategist-WV1">Prowl - Military Strategist</a>. </p>

<p>Ruckus gains +2 health. Ruckus costs 11 stars, and typically has 12 health. In latter waves, an 11 star would more typically have 14 health, so this health boost is largely about making sure Ruckus isn't chronically unhealthy now that he costs 12 stars with the stratagem. </p>
<p>If it feels like you see this a lot, this is a general design issue when boosting a character with a stratatgem, especially a Wave 1 or Wave 2 character. Ruckus basically moves from being an 11 star to a 12 star character, and given that early wave characters were slightly less healthy than later waves, this makes him an unhealthy bot. The designer can find some way to help them repair, max their power so they go out in a blaze of glory, or simply add more health. Simple is often better, and adding more health makes sense. </p>

</figure>

<p>Cars are all about flipping to the alt-mode with Start Your Engines, so the first thing the designers have done here is to ensure that Ruckus has a good flip to alt-mode. They've taken Private Red Alert's Repair 1 and stretched it to a Repair 1 for Team, and they've also included a smaller version of Prowl's boldness with a Bold-1 on flip. Powerful stuff. Let's imagine you played Start Your Engines on your team or Mayhem Ruckus, Private Red Alert and Prowl (25 Stars), you repaired for 4, and one of your cars is sitting on Bold 3. A nicely placed Toolbox would stretch that team repair of 4 to 6. </p>

<p>That's not all however. The team have obviously decided that flipping to alt-mode is for Autobot brrm-brrms. They've given this to Ruckus, all glorious 12 stars of Mayhem, for both his flips. Let's update that Start Your Engines by flipping Ruckus to bot mode, and then using Start Your Engines to flip him back. You'll need someone to still be in Car mode for the first flip but you're still looking at a minimum of 6 repair (rising to 8 with Toolbox), and that Car getting Bold 4, if we imagine that Prowl was in bot mode. It's time for the reader to jettison Private Red Alert and look for a different Car to play. Who will you choose?</p>

<p>Our next card is a stratagem for Wave 2's <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/bombshell-decepticon-psy-ops-ROC">Bombshell - Decepticon Psy Ops</a>. </p>

<p>Bombshell is the 'weaker' partner to Wave 1's Autobot Cosmos. Unlike Cosmos, who can KO a character merely by reshuffling, Bombshell needs the player to scrap the same number of cards as the stars of the character they are attacking. if they do, insta-KO for the defender. Do not flip battle cards. This could be powerful, but of course the great problem is keeping Bombshell alive. Unlike Cosmos, who rocks an abundant 1 health, also 11-star Bombshell has to make do with a measly 15 health. It may sound like a lot for an 11-star, but when you're defending for base 1 and hoping to pick up cards, that's a lot of hoping. </p>

<p>The Ark have focused on keeping Bombshell alive. Depending on the number of cards in your hand, they have provided Bombshell with that most yearned for ability, that most elusive of design options, that most holy of TF TCG holies - ANTI-PIERCE. If you have a modest hand size of less than 5 cards, Bombshell is showing off some snazzy anti-pierce of 2. Not bad. Hold onto those cards a little and he's picking up the anti-pierce to 3, until you reach eight cards and beyond and achieve anti-pierce nirvana..... 4! No longer will you have to watch the Cosmos decks flying along with their Rescue Patrol buddies to KO most of the field, now you can sit tight behind your Blue battle icons and save up your cards for that pinnacle that not even Cosmos can reach, a 25-card Metroplex KO. </p>

<p>Given you are building up those cards, <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/crankcase-data-collector-TMA">Crankcase</a> feels like a good partner for Bombshell. He will quickly be hitting for 8, making him a threat to your opponents. If you're up against someone who is a little too good at knocking cards out of your hand, his <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/data-protection-TMA">Data Protection</a> stratagem will be essential in your sideboard, and you can play a Draw 3 <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/universal-network-access-ROC">Universal Network Access</a> in the meantime. That leaves you 5 stars for to look for card draw or perhaps some additional Tough. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Lastly, and my favourite of the three, is Scan the Vaults. Typically I am a self-declared lover of retro-stratagems, but in this case it's the simplicity of this card that draws me in. </p>

<p>Scan the Vault simply reads "Draw a card. Then draw a card for each Scan the Vaults in your scrap pile. ". I've seen this type of card in other card games, and the concept has been nicely applied to Transformers TCG. The Green and Blue battle icons are nice, but also frustratingly so in that you won't want the first Scan the Vault you see. You will probably pick up the second one you see, and play it for the Pep Talk like Draw 2, and then you will have your fingers crossed that you can see/play the third one before a reshuffle. And we all know that it's going to be the bottom card on the pile don't we?</p>

<p>There will be better tactics than simply watching the cards fly on by. For one that Autobots will love:</p>

<ul class='boxed play'>
    <li>Let's say you've grabbed all three in a heavy draw deck. </li>
    <li>Out comes Confidence - Draw 2, scrap two of your Scan the Vaults, then play your third Scan the vaults to Draw 3 more. </li>
    <li>You've just shifted 5 cards into your hand - did you get your Daring Escape, Peace Through Tyranny and I Still Function!?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Non-Squishy Bombshell</b> will also enjoy Scan the Vault, though his evil bugness will have to come up with a different scheme to max out the card draw. And <b>Mayhem Ruckus</b> will be next in line for some faster card draw, the better to get those Toolboxes and Start Your Engines. </p>
