<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.12</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>A concept you will eventually come across in TF:TCG is that, when a bunch of somethings happen at the same time, the attacking player does their parts of the somethings, and then the defending player does their parts of the somethings. Or more formally, borrowing from a recent roundup, "when both players trigger an ability at the same time, the active player's abilities will complete before the defending player's". As this has been a big topic in Wave 5, let's look at some examples of what this means. </p>

<p>We'll dive right in with Wave 5's problem maker, Decepticon Quake. Decepticon Quake has a brilliantly chaotic feature; when someone is KO'd he does 1 damage to everyone but him. That doesn't sound like a lot at first, doing 1 damage to everyone wouldn't be a game-changing battle card, but if someone else is KO'd by that damage, it can connect into a whole complex cascade of KO's. Wave 5's introduction of Head and Body Modes has contributed a lot to the complexity. </p>

<p>Let's walk through some Quake's in body-mode plays. First let's look at what happens when a Body mode character is deployed: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Decepticons: Decepticon Quake/Kreb, Fangry/Chasm, Windsweeper</li>
    <li>Autobots: Sergeant Kup/Autobot Stylor, Perceptor/Parsec, Dinobot Slug</li>
    <li>Windsweeper attacks into Sergeant Kup, KO'ing him. Deploying Autobot Stylor is triggered. Quake's Bot mode is also triggered. </li>
    <li>The Decepticon team is the active player, they resolve their triggered effects first. There's only one, so they do 1 damage to Windsweeper and 1 damage to Fangry/Chasm. </li>
    <li>The Autobot team is the other player. The Autobots have two effects to resolve. They choose to resolve the damage first, doing 1 damage to Perceptor and Slug, and then they choose to deploy Stylor. </li>
</ol>

<p>Normally the defending player will want to deploy their head after the Quake damage is taken; but perhaps the damage cascade is in their favour: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Let's imagine they choose to deploy Stylor first, then do 1 damage to each of their characters. This KO's Stylor and Quake's effect triggers again. </li>
    <li>The Decepticon team is still the active player. Another 1 damage is done to Windsweeper and Fangry. </li>
    <li>Then its the Autobot team's turn. They have one triggered effect to resolve, so they do 1 more damage to Perceptor and Slug. </li>
</ol>
