<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.12</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>A concept you will eventually come across in TF:TCG is that, when a bunch of somethings happen at the same time, the attacking player does their parts of the somethings, and then the defending player does their parts of the somethings. Or more formally, borrowing from a recent roundup, "when both players trigger an ability at the same time the active player's abilities will complete before the defending player". As this has been a big topic in Wave 5, let's look at some examples of what this means. </p>

<p>We'll dive right in with Wave 5's problem maker, Decepticon Quake. Decepticon Quake has a brilliantly chaotic feature; when someone is KO'd he does 1 damage to everyone but him. That doesn't sound like a lot, it's not much different from a Strafing Run (Do 1 damage to each enemy) or Photon Bomb (Do 2 damage to each character). However, the introduction of Head and Body Modes at the same time causes a lot of complexity. </p>

<p>Let's walk through some imaginary plays. </p>
