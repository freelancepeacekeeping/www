<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.07.02</h3>

<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>A concept you will eventually come across in TF:TCG is that, when a bunch of somethings happen at the same time, the attacking player does their parts of the somethings, and then the defending player does their parts of the somethings. Or more formally, borrowing from a <a href="https://tftcg.info/wave-5/keywords/head-mode-body-mode.html#Rules_Roundup-2020-06-10__610-5">recent roundup</a>, "when both players trigger an ability at the same time, the active player's abilities will complete before the defending player's". As this has been a big topic in Wave 5, let's look at some examples of what this means. </p>

<p>We'll dive right in with Wave 5's problem maker, <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/decepticon-quake-ground-assault-TMA">Decepticon Quake</a>. Decepticon Quake has a brilliantly chaotic feature; when someone is KO'd he does 1 damage to everyone but him. That doesn't sound like a lot at first, doing 1 damage to everyone wouldn't be a game-changing battle card, but if someone else is KO'd by that damage, it can connect into a whole complex cascade of KO's. Wave 5's introduction of Head and Body Modes has contributed a lot to the complexity. </p>

<p>Let's walk through some Quake's in body-mode plays. First let's look at what happens when a Body mode character is deployed: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Our Battlefield is:<ul>
            <li>Decepticons: Decepticon Quake/Kreb, Fangry/Vorath, Windsweeper</li>
            <li>Autobots: Sergeant Kup/Autobot Stylor, Perceptor/Parsec, Dinobot Slug</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Windsweeper attacks into Sergeant Kup, KO'ing him. Deploying Autobot Stylor is triggered. Quake's Bot mode is also triggered. </li>
    <li>The Decepticon team is the active player, they resolve their triggered effects first. There's only one, so they do 1 damage to Windsweeper and 1 damage to Fangry/Vorath. </li>
    <li>The Autobot team is the other player. The Autobots have two effects to resolve. They choose to resolve the damage first, doing 1 damage to Perceptor and Slug, and then they choose to deploy Stylor. </li>
</ol>

<p>Normally the defending player will want to deploy their head after the Quake damage is taken; but perhaps the damage cascade is in their favour: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Let's imagine they choose to deploy Stylor first, then do 1 damage to each of their characters. This KO's Stylor and Quake's effect triggers again. </li>
    <li>The Decepticon team is still the active player. Another 1 damage is done to Windsweeper and Fangry. </li>
    <li>Then its the Autobot team's turn. They have one triggered effect to resolve, so they do 1 more damage to Perceptor and Slug. </li>
</ol>

<p>Let's turn the table on the Decepticons. Let's look at what happens when the Autobots are attacking: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Our Battlefield is:<ul>
            <li>Decepticons: Decepticon Quake/Kreb, Fangry/Vorath, Windsweeper</li>
            <li>Autobots: Sergeant Kup/Autobot Stylor, Perceptor/Parsec, Dinobot Slug</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Perceptor attacks into Fangry, KO'ing him. Deploying Vorath is triggered. Quake's Bot mode is also triggered. </li>
    <li>The Autobot team is the active player, so they resolve their triggered effects first. One damage is done to each of their characters. </li>
    <li>The Decepticon team is the other player, they resolve their triggered effects. They have two effects to resolve and, like the Autobots in the last game, can choose to deploy the head first to kick off another round of damage, or to do the damage first. </li>
</ol>

Image ideas:

Show the board layout as cards?
Animate it, showing health?


Next:

Decepticons are attacking the Autobots.

Cons:  1 damage.
Bots:  1 damage. Hold on deploy Head. Someone was KO'd on the Autobot side! (put the Deploy Head aside)
Cons:  1 damage.
Bots:  1 damage.
Bots:  Deploy Head.

<p class="sidenote">
    <i>In some more complex game situations, handling a triggered ability may itself cause other triggered abilities to trigger. The most recent ability to trigger is the one whose effect happens first. If multiple abilities trigger at the same time, and during the resolution of those abilities one or more new triggered abilities trigger, the remaining original triggered abilities wait until the newer abilities are all handled. Once an ability triggers, it will resolve even if the character with that ability flips or is KOâ€™d, or even if the Upgrade with that ability leaves the battlefield.</i>

<pre>
Examples to look at; however the complexity just from the first two is probably more than enough. 
   Cascading from a damage.
   Cascading from an attack.
   Raider Rumble's Revenge.  (Hazardous Shield, Raider Ratbat, Trypticon as worthy mentions)
   Erratic Energy Grenade.
   ISF/Involuntary Promotion.
   Elita-1.
   Sky-Combiners. (Sky Shadow as worthy mention)
   Venin + Bug Bomb.
