<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.17</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>One of the most powerful cards in TF:TCG is <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/peace-through-tyranny-WV1">Peace Through Tyranny</a>, but when you're starting the game it doesn't feel that way. </p>

<p>Peace Through Tyranny, or PTT as it's affectionately known, gives you another turn at the price of one of your characters being KO. Often that would be a questionable decision, but I'd like to share two specific situations where PTT can be very powerful. </p>

<p>The first is fairly simple. PTT is a great way to KO a Battlemaster or Weaponizer and to immediately use it. One of your characters gets to use your new Upgrade, and then you get another turn. Or instead of getting an Upgrade, you might have a Combiner like Skytread, Tidal Wave, or Sky Shadow who you want to combine. </p>

<p>The second depends on playing PTT on the turn when you are attacking out (also known colloquially as 'the end of the wheel'). You KO one of your characters, attacking with the rest, and then get to go again with everyone now untapped. Played at the right time, PTT might give you three attacks without your opponent being able to attack back. That's game changing. </p>

<p>Wave 5 brings a new version of the end of 'wheel'. Imagine you have one character left untapped and your opponent's characters are all tapped. You have a Peace Through Tyranny, and one of your tapped characters is a Body Mode. By playing PTT on the Body Mode, you can deploy the Head and attack twice, followed by another turn in which you get to attack again. Just make sure you don't KO your opponent's Body Mode character otherwise you'll deploy an untapped Head and lose one of your potential attacks. </p>

<p>If you'd mostly looked at Peace Through Tyranny as another <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/improvised-shield-TMA">Improvised Shield</a>, a double-orange battle icon card, I hope this encourages you to play it more often. Thank you for reading. </p>
