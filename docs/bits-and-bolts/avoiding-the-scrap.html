<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TFTCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.25</h3>

<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. Let's discuss some synergies that plan the deck for your advantage. </p>



A lot of the Transformers game is built around the concept of events. Each turn in a Transformers game is made up of a series of events. Player's cards are listening for those events, and when these events happen, effects on the listening cards trigger. 

A pair of events you will see a lot of are "when this attacks" and "when this defends"; or as a short-hand that covers both; "when this battles". Many cards listen to these events, though they may not use the exact language of "when this". For example, Wave 1's Dinobot Sludge states that "When one of your Dinobots attacks &rarr; Repair 1 damage from it", and Wave 2's Decepticon Crown says "When one of your Decepticon attacks &rarr; Plan 1". Despite the slightly different language, all of these respond to the same event.

Many of these events are described in the <a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035661992-Transformers-TCG-Expanded-Rules-2-0">Expanded Rules 2.0</a> document. For example, the battle events are covered in section 3.A.5:

<p class="sidenote">
"3.A.5. Any ability that triggers “when this attacks,” “when this defends,” “when this battles,” or similar and doesn’t refer to the results of battle cards being flipped resolves."
</p>

Further down in that document is another event, namely the "after this attacks". It's covered in section 4.1:

<p class="sidenote">
4.1. After damage is done, any ability that happens “after the attack” happens, including the effects of green battle icons.
</p>

<p>While it's not stated explicitly in the document, we assume that this section also covers <i>"after this defends"</i>. An example of a card with "after this attacks" is the ever popular Grenade Launcher, while Evasive Maneuvers triggers on "after this defends". In each case, and with Blast Shield and Power Punch, the cards scrap themselves after the attack. </p>

<p>

Wave 4 changed the language it uses for this type of card. Instead of saying "after this attacks", they now say "When the upgraded character attacks &rarr; Scrap this card after the battle". Instead of triggering directly on section 4.1, they now trigger on section 3.A.5, attaching an instruction that will happen at 4.1. This change, applied to the Weapons Crowbar, Crystal of Power, and Fusion Borer, and to the Armors Emergency Barricade and Crystal of Power, allows for some nice synergy with a few of the game's characters. 

Way back in Wave 1, Chop Shop was a common member of the Insecticons. One of its party tricks, when in Bot mode, is to take an Upgrade from another character "when it attacks".




When this attacks &rarr; You may move an Upgrade from one of your other characters to this one



Emergency Barricade, Crystal of Power, 
Crowbar, Crystal of Power, Fusion Borer

You might wonder about if this also works for cards like Grenade Launcher. Wave 1 and Wave 2 used different language that doesn't work this way. For example, a Grenade Launcher says <i>"After the upgraded character attacks &rarr; Scrap this card"</i>. The "After attacks" event is a separate event, it's the first phase in the Post-Attack section, 4.1. 



    When the upgraded character battles &rarr; Scrap this card after the battle"</i>. 


Armor: Blast Shield, Evasive Maneuvers
Weap : Grenade Launcher, Power Punch, 
But not always: RR Disruption Blade  (yes with backup bag etc; but not with the characters)
