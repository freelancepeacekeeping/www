<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TFTCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.07.20</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. Let's discuss some synergies that plan the deck for your advantage. </p>

<p>One of the intriguing design decisions in Wave 5 was that having an Autobot Head on a Decepticon Body (Autocon), or a Decepticon Head on an Autobot Body (Deceptibot), made a character both an Autobot and a Decepticon. One strong synergy with a character who is both an Autobot and a Decepticon is the ability to use two of Wave 4's Mercenary Actions. </p>

  <figcaption>Autocons, and Deceptibots, love those Opportune moments</figcaption>

<p>Building a team made of a Mercenary and two Autocons and/or Deceptibots opens up the Mercenary cards to your team. Chief of those are Opportune Repairs, repair 3 damage, and Opportune Offensive, attack for three-pierce-three. Of these the Autocons are the more powerful as their Decepticon Heads have more value for extra pierce damage, than the Autobot Heads have for repair. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading; I hope this was short, sweet, and informative. </p>
