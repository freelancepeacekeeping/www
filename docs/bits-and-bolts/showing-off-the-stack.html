<h1>Showing Off The Stack</h1>
<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.24</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>Wave 4's <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/showing-off-WS2">Showing Off</a> is one of the few times in Transformers that we get to discover "The Stack". The Stack is where the side-effects of our actions are placed while our actions are completed. In Transformers' sister product, Magic the Gathering, the Stack is an important concept <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/stack-and-its-tricks-2017-11-30">with</a> <a href="http://www.essentialmagic.com/articles/TheStack.asp">many</a> <a href="https://www.boardgamebarrister.com/magic-what-is-the-stack/">articles</a>. </p>

<p>Stacks are a concept from computer programming where the last thing to go onto a stack is the first thing that gets taken off a stack. This is very boring when only one item is put on the stack and then taken off, but when two items are put on the stack, the game's behaviour may be surprising to you. </p>

<p>The Expanded Rules 2.0 lets us know we're working with a stack (without naming it as such) when it says: </p>

<p class="sidenote">
"In some more complex game situations, handling a triggered ability may itself cause other triggered abilities to trigger. <b>The most recent ability to trigger is the one whose effect happens first.</b> If multiple abilities trigger at the same time, and during the resolution of those abilities one or more new triggered abilities trigger, the remaining original triggered abilities wait until the newer abilities are all handled. Once an ability triggers, it will resolve even if the character with that ability flips or is KOâ€™d, or even if the Upgrade with that ability leaves the battlefield. "
</p>

<p>Because Showing Off has two parts, flip then flip again, it's possible to have more than one side-effect on the stack. There are four characters who have 'when you flip to this mode' effects on both sides, so let's look at three of them and understand how their effects get stacked. Then we'll look at the fourth, Twin Twist as the Stack impacts one of his effects in a different way. </p>

<p><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/octone-capricious-agitator-WS2">Octone - Capricious Agitator</a></p>
<p>Let's imagine we have Octone in bot-mode. Our opponent is down to Horri-Bull, with 8 damage, and Parsec as his head. We play Showing Off. We're going to flip him to each alt-mode to win the game, but we're going to do it by flipping to the Autobot damage mode first. </p>
<ol class="play">
    <li>We play Showing Off, selecting Octone. </li>
    <li>We flip Octone to Alt1 Mode; putting a <i>"Do 1 damage to an Autobot"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We flip Octone to Alt2 Mode; putting a <i>"Do 1 damage to a Decepticon"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We resolve the top of the stack; doing 1 damage to Horri-Bull. </li>
    <li>Horri-Bull is KO'd. Parsec is deployed. </li>
    <li>We resolve the top of the stack; doing 1 damage to Parsec. </li>
    <li>Parsec is KO'd. We Win!!! </li>
</ol>

<p>That was... unexpected. I'm hope I'm not alone in feeling that the Octone flip order was backwards from how I expected I would have to play it; but if I'd played it the way I'd expect it to be played, I'd have wasted my damage to an Autobot. While an attacking Octone is sure to KO Parsec, if they had another character left on the field, I wouldn't be able to win the game on that turn. </p>

<p><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/autobot-gears-transport-reconnaissance-TMA">Autobot Gears - Transport and Reconnaissance</a></p>
<p>Let's look at Gears now. Gears is useful for messing with your opponent's Upgrades, but a Showing Off play could be surprising there. Let's start with Gears in Bot mode, and let's assume our opponent has two characters, each with an Armor. </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>We play Showing Off, selecting Gears. </li>
    <li>We flip Gears to Alt mode; putting a <i>"Move an Upgrade from an enemy to another enemy"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We flip Gears to Bot mode; putting a <i>"Return an Upgrade on an enemy to it's owner's hand"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We resolve the top of the stack; returning one of the Armors to our opponent's hand. </li>
    <li>We resolve what's now top of the stack; moving the remaining Armor to the other character. </li>
    <li>One of our opponent's characters still has an Armor. </li>
</ol>

<p>That's not great. Let's try again, this time with Gears in Alt mode. </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>We play Showing Off, selecting Gears. </li>
    <li>We flip Gears to Bot mode; putting a <i>"Return an Upgrade on an enemy to it's owner's hand"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We flip Gears to Alt mode; putting a <i>"Move an Upgrade from an enemy to another enemy"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We resolve the top of the stack; moving the one character's Armor on top of the other, scrapping the other Armor. </li>
    <li>We resolve what's now top of the stack; returning the recently moved Armor to our opponent's hand. </li>
    <li>Our opponent's characters have no armor. </li>
</ol>

<p>It's counter-intuitive, but it turns out that Showing Off is better played on Autobot Gears when he's in Alt mode. </p>

<p><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/sergeant-springer-special-ops-aerial-defense-WS2">Sergeant Springer - Special Ops, Aerial Defense</a></p>
<p>Sergeant Springer has three "when you flip" effects, which gives us quite the permutation of options. Let's consider flipping to each of the Alt modes, and then let's consider flipping to an Alt mode and his Bot mode. </p>

<p>TO BE WRITTEN</p>

<p><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/twin-twist-demolitions-TMA">Twin Twist - Demolitions</a></p>
<p>Lastly, let's look at Twin Twist. Unlike the previous three characters, Twin Twist doesn't have any odd ordering as his Alt mode Pierce 3 flip effect has no immediate impact. However his Body mode effect is very interesting. Because flip effects are put on the stack, Twin Twist <b>always</b> does 1 damage to everyone when he plays Showing Off, regardless of which mode he began in. This is again a bit counter-intuitive when Twin Twist starts in Alt-mode, so let's walk through that play. </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>We play Showing Off, selecting Twin Twist (Alt mode). </li>
    <li>We flip Twin Twist to Body mode; putting a <i>"Your opponent chooses one of their characters and does 1 damage do it. If you flipped this character at least 2 times this turn, instead do 1 damage to each enemy. "</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We flip Twin Twist to Alt mode; putting a <i>"This gets Pierce 3 until end of turn"</i> onto the Stack. </li>
    <li>We resolve the top of the stack; Twin Twist gets Pierce 3. </li>
    <li>We resolve what's now top of the stack; we do 1 damage to each enemy. </li>
</ol>

<p>Because the flip effects are put on the stack, Twin Twist will always have flipped twice with a Showing Off when it comes time to resolve those effects. Twin Twist is all about Showing Off; as if you needed even more of a reason to play Showing Off with Twin Twist! </p>

<p>I hope that was useful, and you're not too up in arms right now demanding to know why things are this way. If you are demanding to know why things are this way, the typical Magic The Gathering example is to explain that it must be this way otherwise counterspells won't work. The counterspell will always trail the spell.  For Transformers, I suspect the reality is that experience has shown the Stack works for these types of games, and that as the Transformers game grows, we will see new features whose sanity rely on the Stack working the way it does. Thank you for reading. </p>
