<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.12</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>Today, let's discover a nice trick to bring a bot back from the KO pile, without having to give them back. </p>

<p>I'm sure you know the <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/i-still-function-WV1">I Still Function!</a> card. It allows you to bring a character back from the KO pile with 1 remaining health, as long as you return them to the KO area at the end of your turn. It's a powerful card, which is why it's devoid of battle icons. It's even more powerful when used with the mini-cassettes. </p>

<p>One nice synergy is with <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/raider-rumble-spy-patrol-demolitions-WS2">Raider Rumble</a>. Let's say Raider Rumble is in your KO area and you play I Still Function! (commonly known as ISF) to bring him back. You ensure he's in his cassette mode, then at the end of your turn you get to his Revenge effect; it's time to do 2 damage to an opponent's character. Using an ISF to get a 2 damage may not be the best use of the card, but in Wave 5 it's become a favourite trick in Quake decks (where that I Still Function! on Rumble becomes 1 damage to everyone but Quake, and 2 damage to an opponent character of your choice). </p>

<p>ISF and the Mini-Cassettes is not just about Rumble however. The nicest use of I Still Function! with Blaster and Soundwave's Mini-Cassettes will work with any of the cassettes. The Blaster vs Soundwave set came with the <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/recover-cassette-BVS">Recover Cassette</a> card. Recover Cassette lets you place one of the music player's cassettes back under them, additionally healing another of your characters. A nice card, though you do have to put it in the KO area after using it. </p>

<p>So let's imagine you've brought a cassette back onto the battlefield with an I Still Function!, and then you play Recover Cassettes. You might have used a <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/brainstorm-WV1">Brainstorm</a> to play both of those, or you might have played a Recover Cassettes as the top card of your deck when flipping <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/blaster-communications-BVS">Blaster</a>. As explained in <a hef="https://tftcg.info//wave-3/battle-cards/recover-cassette.html#Rules_Roundup-2019-10-11__7-3">this FAQ</a>, your recovered cassette gets to cheat the KO, and is fully healed to boot: </p>

<p class="sidenote">
    <dt>In a turn where I play Brainstorm, allowing for 2 more actions. I play I Still Function!, bringing Buzzsaw (Spy) from the KO Area, then I play Recover Cassette, putting Buzzsaw underneath Soundwave. Will that cancel out I Still Function!?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, it will. Once Buzzsaw goes underneath Soundwave, all existing and/or pending game effects stop applying to him.</dd>
</p>

<p>This is a rather specific piece of synergy, but there are few ways to heal a character fully, and fewer ways to return a character to the battlefield fully healed. Something to bear in mind for any Blaster or Soundwave decks. </p>
