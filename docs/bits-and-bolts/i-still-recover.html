<h1>I Still Recover!</h1>
<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.02</h3>



<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>Today, let's discover a nice trick to bring a bot back from the KO pile, without having to give them back. </p>

<p>I'm sure you know the I Still Function! card. It allows you to bring a character back from the KO pile with 1 remaining health, as long as you return them to the KO area at the end of your turn. It's a powerful card, which is why it's devoid of battle icons. It's even more powerful when used with one of the cassettes. </p>

<p>I could be talking about Raider Rumble. Let's say Raider Rumble is in your KO area and you play I Still Function! (commonly known as ISF) to bring him back. You ensure he's in his cassette mode, then at the end of your turn you get to his Revenge effect; it's time to do 2 damage to an opponent's character. </p>

<p>We're not talking about Rumble today though. Instead we're going to talk about the Blaster and Soundwave's Mini-Cassettes. Both of those characters came with the Recover Cassettes card. Recover Cassettes lets you place one of the music player's cassettes back under them, additionally healing another of your characters. A nice card, though you do have to put it in the KO area after using it. </p>

<p>So let's imagine you've brought a cassette back onto the battlefield with an I Still Function!, and then you play Recover Cassettes. You might have used a Brainstorm to play both of those, or you might have played a Recover Cassettes as the top card of your deck when flipping Blaster. So what happens when the cassette returns to the battlefield and hides under the music player? They get to stay! </p>

<p>A lot of words to tell you that playing two cards cheats death, but a tweet felt too short. Thank you for reading. </p>
