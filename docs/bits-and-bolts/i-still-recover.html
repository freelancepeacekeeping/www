<h1>I Still Recover!</h1>
<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.12</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>Today, let's discover a nice trick to bring a bot back from the KO pile, without having to give them back. </p>

<p>I'm sure you know the <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/i-still-function-WV1">I Still Function!</a> card. It allows you to bring a character back from the KO pile with 1 remaining health, as long as you return them to the KO area at the end of your turn. It's a powerful card, which is why it's devoid of battle icons. It's even more powerful when used with one of the mini-cassettes. </p>

<p>I could be talking about <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/raider-rumble-spy-patrol-demolitions-WS2">Raider Rumble</a>. Let's say Raider Rumble is in your KO area and you play I Still Function! (commonly known as ISF) to bring him back. You ensure he's in his cassette mode, then at the end of your turn you get to his Revenge effect; it's time to do 2 damage to an opponent's character. </p>

<p>We're not talking about Rumble today though. Instead we're going to talk about the Blaster and Soundwave's Mini-Cassettes. Both of those characters came with the <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/recover-cassette-BVS">Recover Cassette</a> card. Recover Cassettes lets you place one of the music player's cassettes back under them, additionally healing another of your characters. A nice card, though you do have to put it in the KO area after using it. </p>

<p>So let's imagine you've brought a cassette back onto the battlefield with an I Still Function!, and then you play Recover Cassettes. You might have used a <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/brainstorm-WV1">Brainstorm</a> to play both of those, or you might have played a Recover Cassettes as the top card of your deck when flipping <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/blaster-communications-BVS">Blaster</a>. So what happens when the cassette returns to the battlefield and hides under the music player? They get to stay! </p>

<p>A lot of words to tell you that playing two cards cheats death, but a tweet felt too short. Thank you for reading. </p>
