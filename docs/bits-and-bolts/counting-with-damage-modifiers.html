<h1>Counting With Damage Modifiers</h1>
<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.06.22</h3>


<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>Damage outside of attacks and repairing are two parts of the game that have increased in importance as the game has developed. In addition to more and more cards that inflict or repair damage, there are also cards to block or boost those damage effects. Sometimes the counting in these cards can be confusing, so let's look at how the counting works with some of the synergies. </p>

<p><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/medic-WV1">Medic!</a>, <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/emergency-maintenance-WV1">Emergency Maintenance</a>, and <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/versatility-TMA">Versatility</a> are three repairing cards, repairing 2, 1-3, and 0-5, damage respectively. If you're doing a lot of healing, you'll want to use the <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/toolbox-WS2">Toolbox</a> utility, which repairs another damage for each time your character is repaired. How do you determine how many times your character has been repaired though?</p>

<p>The Medic! card is an easy place to start. It says "Repair 2 damage from one of your characters". If you repair 2 damage from a character who has a Toolbox, you will get to repair 3 damage instead. </p>

<p>Emergency Maintenace is a little more complex. It says to "Repair 1 damage from one of your characters. If you have more Stars of characters in your KO area than you have on the battlefield, repair 2 more damage from character. ". Let's assume that you do have more Stars in your KO area. You will repair 1 damage from your Toolbox upgraded character, then you will repair another 2 damage. Each time you repair, the Toolbox will add another 1; leading to you actually repairing for 2 and then 3, for a total of 5 repaired damage. </p>

<p>Versatility is the last repairing card we'll look at. It says "Choose one of your characters. When it attacks for the first time this turn and you flip at least one battle icon &rarr; Repair 1 damage from it for each different color among battle icons you flipped. ". In this case you are first flipping a bunch of cards, then you are calculating how many colors you flipped, then you heal that much. Let's assume you hit the jackpot and flipped 5 different battle icon colors and healed our Toolbox upgraded character. Instead of healing 5, you would heal 6. </p>
