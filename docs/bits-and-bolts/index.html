  <h2>Social Media Snippet</h2>
  <p>
  Bits and Bolts, very short reads that cover some form of card synergy in #TransformersTCG that might not be obvious to someone new to the game.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Media Snippet v2 (edited)</h2>
  <p>
  Bits and Bolts, short reads on #TransformersTCG card synergy for folk new to the game.
  </p>

  <h2>Ideas</h2>
  <pre>

Other Synergies:

Repair vs Move
    Ratbat and the Wedge Formation Plan
    Skrapnel healing

Ranged card synergies? Marksmanship etc
Specialist card synergies?  Field Communicator etc

Nitro Booster and who it might be useful for

Mission Briefing and quick bot modes
    Mini-Cassettes
    Battlemasters

    Turn this into a general article on Modes. Explain the Bot and Body to folk. 
    Talk about 'what does the card say?'
    Then say that Mission Briefing is a great gift from W5. 
    Talk about cassettes and battlemasters. Especially the blue Soundwave world.


Shockwave, Caliburst, and a card drawing deck

Sgt Springer, EMP Wave, and Conversion Engine


W1 Chop Shop shenanigans with Upgrades?

Slipstream and Windsweeper?

Start Your Engines and the 19 Cars with "When you flip to this mode"

Coup and Bounty effect to get double Bounties

Play vs Put stepped away from Chop Shop and Soundblaster and the whole concept of 
Not Scrapping. That's worth its own article. 

Expanded Rules. Talk about the event concept. 
This might fit well with Chop Shop/Soundblaster above. 

Quake. The FAQ. So what's it all about.
