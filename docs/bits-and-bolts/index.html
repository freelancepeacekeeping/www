  <h2>Draft Articles</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="i-still-recover.html">I Still Recover!</a> (Unlikely to publish; not a great play)</li>
  <li><a href="showing-off-with-stacks.html">Showing Off with Stacks</a> (May not publish; much debate about whether it's accurate)</li>
  <li><a href="a-la-mode.html">A La Mode</a> (Body+Head != Bot)</li>
  <li><a href="the-active-player.html">The Active Player</a> (Quake FAQ article)</li>
  <li>Doubling up Bounties with Coup. Mention how it fails for Deadlock. </li>
  <li>Explain the synergy with Start Your Engines and the 19 Cars with "When you flip to this mode". Perhaps this is a broader look at the vehicular modes to explain the synergies in each. </li>
  <li>Per that; Planes and flinging damage. Windsweeper and Slipstream. </li>
  <li>Show how Shockwave and Caliburst are synergistic. </li>
  <li>Nitro Boosters? (untaps in general?)</li>
  <li>Raider Ratbat and the triple-icon cards. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other Ideas Proposed</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>I reference various other concepts in articles. These should link to discussions of those concepts. Maybe a Glossary. </li>
      <li>List difficulty. Perhaps (my take here) order by complexity so there is a reading order for someone new. </li>
      <li>List of events in the game as listed on each card; linked over to Expanded Rules 2.0. </li>
      <li>Basic playing skills. </li>
      <li>belligerence vs end hostilities; perhaps extend that to anti-synergy; cards which affect each other</li>
      <li>When to play Security Checkpoint? Same for Reckless Charge and OSSOSF. "Backfiring cards" </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Social Media Snippet</h2>
  <p>
  Bits and Bolts, very short reads that cover some form of card synergy in #TransformersTCG that might not be obvious to someone new to the game.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Media Snippet v2 (edited)</h2>
  <p>
  Bits and Bolts, short reads on #TransformersTCG card synergy for folk new to the game.
