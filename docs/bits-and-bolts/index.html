  <h2>Ideas</h2>
  <pre>

Other Synergies:

Repair vs Move
    Ratbat and the Wedge Formation Plan
    Skrapnel healing

Ranged card synergies? Marksmanship etc
Specialist card synergies?  Field Communicator etc

Nitro Booster and who it might be useful for

Mission Briefing and quick bot modes
    Mini-Cassettes
    Battlemasters

Shockwave, Caliburst, and a card drawing deck

Sgt Springer, EMP Wave, and Conversion Engine


W1 Chop Shop shenanigans with Upgrades?

Slipstream and Windsweeper?

Start Your Engines and the 19 Cars with "When you flip to this mode"

Coup and Bounty effect to get double Bounties

Play vs Put stepped away from Chop Shop and Soundblaster and the whole concept of Not Scrapping. That's worth its own article. 

Expanded Rules. Talk about the event concept. This might fit well with Chop Shop/Soundblaster above.
