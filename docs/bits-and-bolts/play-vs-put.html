<h2>Bits and Bolts - Exploring TF:TCG Synergy</h2>
<h3>2020.05.31</h3>



<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help Transformers the Trading Card Game newcomers discover some of the valuable interactions between different cards. </p>

<p>For our article, let's discuss Play and Put, and suggest some synergies that come from this difference. </p>

<p>A common word you will see in TF:TCG is <i>Play</i>. When you place a card from your hand onto the battlefield (aka the table in front of you), you are Playing it. You might also Play a card as a result of another card. For example, you might Play the <i>Leap of Faith</i> action, which requires you to scrap the top two cards of your deck, and to optionally Play them. </p>

<p>You will also see Play used as a requirement for a card. For example, Wave 5's <i>Master Sword</i> instructs you to only Play Master Sword onto a character who has no empty Weapon slots. </p>

<p>This is all simple enough. So what is Put?</p>

<p><i>Put</i> is another common word you will see in TF:TCG. Put refers to the act of an Upgrade being attached to a character. When you Play an Upgrade card, part of the act you are doing is a Put. For the purposes of sketching Play and Put, let's (incorrectly) describe the Playing of an Upgrade as: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Move the Upgrade card to the battlefield in the direction of a character. </li>
    <li>Check any Play conditions of the Upgrade for that character. </li>
    <li>Check any Put conditions of the Upgrade for that character. </li>
    <li>Put the Upgrade on the character. </li>
    <li>Apply any Play effects described by the Upgrade. </li>
    <li>Apply any Put effects described by the Upgrade. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is incorrect because most of this happens as one step, rather than a series of steps, but it suffices to show you Play and Put. It doesn't explain why it matters, so your feeling of "So What?" is completely justified. You will see if we look at how moving an Upgrade works. Let's sketch out a Move: </p>

<ol class="play">
    <li>Start to move an Upgrade from one character to another.</li>
    <li>Check any Put conditions of the Upgrade for that character. </li>
    <li>Put the Upgrade on the character. </li>
    <li>Apply any Put effects described by the Upgrade. </li>
</ol>

<p>Again it's incorrect because we've pulled apart a single step; however notice that the core difference between Playing and Moving an Upgrade, are that the Play conditions are not checked when you Move an Upgrade. This leads to two interesting synergies. The first is that you can move an Upgrade onto a character who it couldn't be Played on; and the second is that you get to repeat Put effects after moving. </p>

<p>For the first, let's imagine you have two characters. One of the characters has a Master Sword, and the other has no Weapon. You play Wave 3's Quartermaster. Can you move it to the other character? Yes you can. Quartermaster <i>Moves</i> the Upgrade, and Master Sword has no Put condition, only a Play condition. Congratulations, your second character is ready to smash for +4 Attack. </p>

<p>Another classic approach is when you have a character that lets you Put or Move an Upgrade onto a character. There are five characters who allow you to Move an Upgrade (Chop Shop, Buzzsaw, Ramhorn, Sergeant Soundblaster, and Wave 5's Autobot Gears), but only Wave 1's Jetfire, Air Guardian, lets you Put an Upgrade. When you flip Jetfire to bot-mode, you can put either an Armor or a Utility onto Jetfire from your scrap pile. Historically that meant attaching either Wave 2's Superior Cannon or Superior Jetpack, but now in Wave 5 it also means attaching Ghost Shield without needing an empty Armor slot. </p>

<p>Returning to our two synergies, the second synergy sees you repeating Put effects after moving an Upgrade. Let's imagine you have two characters and you use Quartermaster to move an Armed Hovercraft from one character to the other. Because Armed Hovercraft has a Put effect, you will get to repeat it (doing 1 damage to each of your opponent's characters). Note that your two characters will both need to be Ranged to repeat the Put effect. </p>

<p>Just as with the Jetfire, there are other ways to repeat a Put effect than simply moving an Upgrade between two characters. One approach would be to use Wave 4's Involuntary Promotion. If you swap a KO'd Ranged character for an existing character who is equipped with an Armed Hovercraft, that Put effect will happen again (1 more damage to each of your opponent's characters). That's not the only way however. Let's imagine you have one of Wave 5's characters with a Head and Body mode, such as Autobot Nautica with Convex as her head. You have played a Bashing Shield onto Nautica, scrapping an enemy armor, but it was not enough. Nautica has now been KO'd. Fortunately, you had also equipped Nautica with an Escape Capsule. Convex is deployed in bot mode, then the Escape Capsule and Bashing Shield are put on Convex, leading to another enemy armor to be scrapped. </p>

<p>I hope this has helped you with the Play and Put actions, and that your mind is full of useful synergies to use in your decks. Thank you for reading. </p>
