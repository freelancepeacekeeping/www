<h1>Card Rarity</h1>
<h2>Bits and Bolts and Brewing - Custom TFTCG</h2>
<h3>2020.09.19</h3>

<p>Welcome to Bits and Bolts, a series intended to help folk with Transformers the Trading Card Game. Today, let's talk about brewing custom cards. Specifically, let's talk about deciding what rarity to put on your cards. </p>

<p>It feels a little odd to assign rarity to our cards. We're not packaging them in booster packs, and we're not planning for Turbo and Sealed tournaments. It's still important however to try and assign some concept of rarity to the cards; not only because the card databases are built around rarity, but because the rarity tells us a lot about a card. </p>

<p>Let's start by look at Stratagems. WotC gave us some written direction on their plans for stratagem rarity. </p>

<p>In Wave 5, a Common stratagem added value to a character in that wave. Typically that meant a Common character in the wave, but that was probably more for the random value of Limited play than it was a hard and fast rule. There were also two Common stratagems for Uncommon characters, and one for a Rare character. </p>

<p>Uncommons however, so we were told, were for specific teams. W5 was bad about that, offering us only two Stratagems that helped a team. Seven of the remaining Uncommons were for Super-Rare characters, while the last was for the Rare Head Clobber.  </p>

<p>Lastly, Rare Stratagems were for helping characters not in W5. W5 also decided to break this a few times, providing the Rare Swap Heads stratagem. </p>

<p>Let's try to simplify this shall we? </p>

<p>Our primary use for rarity nowadays is going to be for Junkion (Common) and Pauper (Common and Uncommon) formats. Let's turn the above into some rules that ignore selling boosters and support those tournaments. </p>

<ul>
<li> Common Stratagems are stratagems that are released with the character. It is intended that you always have the choice to use that card. It doesn't matter if you have a Common stratagem for a rarer character, it's just a dead card for Junkion/Pauper and hurting no one. The Stratagem is playtested with the character and anywhere you play the character, you are expected to have the choice of the stratagem. </li>
<li> Uncommon Stratagems are stratagems released generally for a trait (be that tribe (Dinobot etc), vehicle mode (Car etc), or combat-style (Ranged etc)). Trait-based Stratagems are expected to be less powerful than character specific stratagems because there are many options for that trait and it is harder to predict what interesting decks might make use of them. </li>

<li>Rare Stratagems are released specifically for an older character. They were not play-tested with that character, and they make that character more powerful than was expected when that character was play-tested, thus are not a balanced solution in Pauper/Junkion. </li>
</ul>

<p>Next let's talk about Battle Card rarity. </p>

<p>Some aspect of the Battle Card rarity again was due to Limited booster appeal. WotC wanted Primary Laser to show up easily in a game of Turbo, for example. There are still some styles to battle card rarity. </p>

<p>Rare cards. Rare cards are specializing features. Utilities are as likely to be Rare as they are Common or Uncommon. The same is true for Secret Actions.  </p>

<p>10 out of 40 Common Weapons relate to a trait; however they are the common traits. Battle style (Ranged etc) and Faction.  </p>

<p>Common cards generally do not relate to traits. They may relate to Factions. Each style (Ranged/Melee/Specialist) has 1 card that is Common, and there is a Secret Action (Hull Down) which contains a vehicular trait. My suggestion is that we ignore those and avoid using traits on battle icons for Common cards. Common cards are never star cards. At a simple decision point, a Common card is always a fine card to play. </p>

<p>Uncommon cards are often more powerful than Common cards, though that may come with a limitation; for example being scrapped. Their play is more likely to be situational. Uncommon cards may refer to more general traits, such as vehicular and style, as well as Factions. If they relate to a tribe, then they are the weaker of the cards relating to the tribe. Uncommon cards are typically a valuable card to play, ignoring some very specific support cards like Enigmas. Their limitation may be painful, and they may not add a tactical value at that time, it may be better to keep an Uncommon card in hand. </p>

<p>Most Star cards are Uncommons. It's generally accepted that only Star cards may be [W][O][U], and by extension, [W][O] or [W][U].</p>

<p>Rare battle cards are often specific to a character, or the lynchpin support card for a tribe. They are often only of value in very specific decks, and are absolutely intended for Constructed play. In some cases the cards are fairly generic, and are very powerful; for example Belligerence and End Hostilities. </p>

<p>This brings us to rarity for character cards. </p>

<p>Common Characters.</p>

<p>In the early waves; Vanilla characters (i.e. have no text on one or both of their sides) were most likely to be Common. As these were less fun to play, this distinction went away.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In Wave 5, C/SR and U/R were split, making any distinction there less clear.</li>
<li>The highest star cards are Rare or Super-Rare. (13+)</li>
<li>Many 12 stars are SR.</li>
<li>Until W5, SRs were always 10+.</li>
<li>Lots of printing decisions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Specialists: Specialists are unlikely to be a non-Specialist in another mode. (Prowl, Wheeljack, Perceptor)</p>

<p>Looking at Insecticons:</p>

<ul>
<li> Rares have the more unique features. Game changers and disruption.</li>
<li> Uncommons have the Tribal features.</li>
<li> Commons are more useful in a generic deck.</li>
</ul>

<p>W1 Dinobots are similar. The Commons are generic (vanilla even), the Uncommons refer to tribal powers or synergize with Tribal cards, and the Rares are game changers. Example: Dino-chomp empties the hand, so Uncommon Snarl has an empty-hand trigger. </p>

<p>Looking at the Firecons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sparkstalker - Common. A basic aggro character, flip-mode and flip-orange based.</li>
<li>Flamefeather - Uncommon. Tribal effect and a flip-orange. The Flip-orange is defensive however, more useful in a particular tactic.</li>
<li>Cindersaur - Rare. Powerful effect (direct damage), along with a cheat effect of playing another action.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at the Spy Patrol:</p>

<ul>
<li>Soundwave - Uncommon. Provides value to the Spy Patrol.</li>
<li>Spy Patrol themselves - Common. Useful in many situations. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's roll this together:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Common character is generically useful in any deck. It does not provide value to tribal colleagues, its effects are generically useful and they are not game changing. They are more likely to be lower in stars.</li>
<li>An Uncommon character is designed for a particular tribe. It has an effect that helps that tribe, either directly, or because the effect synergises well with another tribe effect. </li>
<li>A Rare character goes beyond tribal effects and is a power in their own right. They have powerful game changing effects, and/or changes to expected run of play (playing extra cards for example). </li>
</ul>
