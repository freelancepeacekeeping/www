<h2>July 2022</h2>
<h2>Transformers TCG, the Fan-Brewed Champagne</h2>

<p>Announcing "Wave 9" of Transformers the Trading Card Game, the first Official Fanbrew release. </p>

<p>In July 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced that they were dropping their support for their novel two-year old card game, Transformers the Trading Card Game. Announcing during a period of pandemic, protest, and political unrest, you would not expect the news to have impacted people's lives, but for the up to 5,000 players of Transformers TCG, it was a shock.</p>

<p>Most would expect the game, and the community, to fade into history; another Wikipedia page that no longer needs updating. That wasn't what happened here. Instead, after some initial grief, the community started to develop their own fanbrew cards. Early cards were created independently, but over time these started to form into the "Triple Wave" release. </p>

<p>The "Triple Wave" release was a huge and gradual release of fan brewed cards. The game's designers had dropped hints for their next three releases (Wave 6, 7, and 8), and the fans had a lot of energy to spend brewing up the cards they hoped the designers would have produced, given the chance. Because there was so much energy, the fans coalesced these ideas aroud three separate groups of cards, all being gradually released at the same time. These Fanbrew Waves were:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Wave 6: War for Cybertron: Earthrise</li>
    <li> Wave 7: Combiners/Throwback (introducing Locations)</li>
    <li> Wave 8: War for Cybertron: Kingdom</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these waves included "Stratagem" cards, designed to boost older cards, and their designs stuck closely to the design parameters the WotC development team had set. In addition, a multiplayer format was developed, along with a co-operative "Raid" format in which players did their best to take down Unicron. Acknowledged as brutally difficult, fans soon started to share videos of how close they had gotten to defeating the evil planet. </p>

<p>By mid-2021, the Triple Wave was declared good and work began on "Wave 9 - The Movie". Using the lessons learned from the Triple Wave, the fans started to stretch the game, adding new keywords, and building multiplayer support directly into the cards. At GenCon 2022 they celebrated this release with their largest tournament to date, with Wizards of the Coast supplying original design materials as prizes. </p>

<p>"I'm so proud of the players. We had to leave them in 2020, to get to come back and have my Quake deck lose in 2022 was an absolute pleasure. " Off-the-record original WotC design team member. </p>

<p>If you're at GenCon this week, make sure to go by the TFTCG booth to pick up the first officially printed materials since 2020. </p>
