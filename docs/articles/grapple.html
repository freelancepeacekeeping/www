<h1>Grappling</h1>
<h3>2020.04.26</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bluesonattack/posts/514580365886857">challenge</a> was put forth on 2020-04-08 by the venerable Nick Petrasiti of Blues on Attack fame. The Back of the Binder #3 challenge was to build a deck around Grapple. Excluded from use are mechanoids who have offended their Royal Bluenesses; namely, Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend and the Air Strike Patrol. The Off-Road Patrol were also excluded from the challenge for being too easy, as were any Wave 5 cards. </p>

<p>Before we dive through a a universe of cards, do a lot of math, and learn about two useful deck-building tools (one premiering in this very article!), let's ask ourselves: "Who is Grapple?"</p>

<hr/>

<p>I don't mean that in a metaphysical way, I'm not seeking to work out if he is a rugged fighter, a dependable builder, or a lover of beauty, though the truth is that he is all of these things; I simply wonder what basic inarguable characteristics represent our subject. </p>
<p>Grapple, an Autbot architect whose works transcended basic engineering to become art forms, first showed in the comic continuity in 1985 when his persona was loaded from a memory stick onto a new form Wheeljack had built. That Optimus had copied some of his warriors in case he needed to build more has always raised the question of whether there is another, original, Grapple roaming the universe, but I think we can deem that unlikely. There were many other times in which being able to copy an Autobot's persona would be useful, that we must deduce that the 'copying' process was destructive, and thus we may be reassured of Grapple's bravery. As Wheeljack didn't simply make a dozen new Grapples, we must also deduce that the Autobots had good reasons to avoid duplicate Grapples, which suggests that Primus and WotC are reading from the same rulebook. Comic-wise Grapple's involvement peaked after building Omega Supreme. Yes, that Omega Supreme. The Wave 4 Combiner. One assumes that the Wave 2 Guardian was something Wheeljack made. Grapple transforms into an orange crane, which comes in useful when humans need rescuing from damaged buildings. </p>

<p>Grapple's role in the G1 cartoon was much the same. He magically appeared a few episodes in, and he built some things. His original toy was clunky and tall, though recent toys have smoothed him out, with the new Earthrise toy being especially pleasing and gaining a grappling hook that, rather oddly, appears to sidemount in Truck mode. </p>

    <figcaption>Looking good...</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Card-wise, Grapple is a Rise of the Combiners (Wave 2) 12-star character with underwhelming stats, 4-11-2 and 4-11-0. That however is a bit of indirection because Grapple's Alt and Bot mode effects are excellent. </p>

    GRAPPLE CARDS
</figure>
https://fortressmaximus.io/card/grapple-autobot-architect-ROC

<p>Grapple revolves around having exactly 4 colours of battle icon. In Bot mode he turns into an 8-11-4 character as long as he flips exactly 4 different colors of battle icon, and when flipped to Alt-mode he can throw out a big 4-damage if, when the player discards their hand, it contains exactly 4 different colors. This changes everything. 8-11-4 makes Grapple a very powerful 12-star character, and a nothing else in the game does an explicit 4-damage. Grapple, fearless architect, goes from a glass-chinned nobody to a powerhouse if you _build_ your deck correctly. Kudos to the design team for making Grapple about deck building. </p>

<p>Grapple is also a fairly simple character. There have been 5 FAQ/Rules-Roundups for Grapple, which you can read at TFTCG.info. </p>
https://tftcg.info//wave-2/characters/grapple-autobot-architect.html

<hr/>

<p>So now we know a little about Grapple. Let's get ready to deck build, and let's learn about how to use the OCTGN Deck Editor at the same time. </p>

<h3>Grappling with deck building in OCTGN's Deck Builder</h3>

<p>My favourite way to build decks is via OCTGN. Its powerful filtering options allow me the confidence that I won't as easily forget about an obscure card that would be ideal for my situation, and having my decks on my computer allows me to file them away in case I want to come back to them someday. </p>


<p>Let's build a Grapple deck with OCTGN. </p>

<p>We'll assume you've installed OCTGN, if not, check out tftcg.info's <a href="https://tftcg.info/octgn/installing-octgn.html">Installing OCTGN</a> section. Let's start it up, logging in is optional, and open the Deck Editor. If Transformers is the only game you've installed then you will already see a spreadsheet view of all of the Transformers TCG cards to date. If not, then you'll need to use <u>File-&gt;New</u> to select Transformers. </p>

<h4>Step 1:  No Wave 5</h4>

<p>Wave 5 is out for the Grapple challenge. So let's filter that out so we're not tempted; at least until later in the article. </p>

<p class="cmd">Click on the <u>Filter:Set</u> menu. Select <u>Wave 5</u> from the dropdown and click the <u>Exclude</u> checkbox. All the Wave 5 card are now removed from the available cards in our search.</p>

<h4>Step 2: His Lordship, Grapple</h4>

<p>Let's go get Grapple. We're going to ponder the rest of the team too, so let's filter to only bots. </p>

<p class="cmd">Click on the <u>Filter:Type</u> option. Leave the drop down as <u>Contains</u> and enter '<u>char</u>' into the entry box. Click outside the box and the list of cards will filter down to only Character cards. </p>
<p class="cmd">Click on the <u>Name</u> column to sort by Name, then scroll down to Grapple and <u>double click</u> on Grapple to add him to the characters section of the deck on the left hand side. </p>

<p>Let's review Grapple again. Grapple costs 12 star, so we only have 13 stars left to play with. In Bot Mode he has a powerful ability of getting +4 in battle when you flip _exactly_ 4 pip colors.  Flipping back to Alt mode you can discard your hand. If it contains exactly 4 pip colors, you can do 4 damage to an enemy, also very powerful at the right moment. You'll see this both in the top left, where Grapple's Alt mode is showing and can be flipped by clicking on an arrow on the image. You'll also see the solitary data row in the spreadsheet section. </p>

<p>As we're building a deck around a particular character, it's important to think about their Flip requirements. If you have someone who wants to flip every turn, you ideally want partners who don't need to flip. Alternatively, if you have someone who rarely flips, then finding folk who do flip may give your deck a boost. With Grapple we will want to flip him as soon as he attacks, not only for that potential base attack of 8, but also to get him out there with his 4 defence. After that though, we will only want to flip Grapple back to Alt mode if it's a game changer, or if he's well proected. Grapple isn't the healthiest bot. </p>

<p>Before the cries of "Libel" emerge from Grapple's lawyersr, let's use OCTGN to disagree. </p>

<p class="cmd">Click the <u>red X</u> on the Name filter (but leave the Type and Set filters). Then click on <u>Filter:Star</u> and enter '<u>12</u>'. </p>
<p class="cmd">Next, click on Hide Alternates to hide the other sides of each character, and then click on HP to sort by the HP column. </p>

<p>As you will see, our lad Grapple is 4th from bottom for 12-star characters when it comes down to their Health. If we ignore the Combiner Skytread, Grapple ranks 15th out of the 18 for Health. Additionally, Novastar and Ion Storm, two characters with higher Health, also have higher Defence than Grapple! </p>

<p>Now we've agreed that Grapple should have exercised a little more, let's also acknowledge that this makes a two-wide deck tricky. </p>
 

<h4>Step 3: Ponder Traits</h4>

<p>Grapple has both Melee and Truck traits. Before we go hunting for partners, let's look at the cards that relate to the Melee and Truck traits. </p>

<p class="cmd">Open up a new Filter tab by clicking on the green plus sign next to "Search #1". </p>
<p class="cmd">Click on the <u>Filter:Text</u> option and type '<u>truck</u>' into the entry field. </p>

<p>You'll note that there are 3 Wave 5 cards showing, this is because a new Search tab opens as a completely vanilla search. It doesn't copy what you've previously searched for.
There are only 4 other cards, so let's remember to ignore the three Wave 5 cards and consider the other four:</p>

<ol>
    <li>4-Wheel Drive. Blue action. Sets base attack to 7. This is a +3 Attack option in Bot mode and a +2 Attack option in Alt mode. For Grapple it's a worse Leap into battle. </p>
    <li>Battering Ram. This is a +2 Blue weapon. It's a Primary Laser which flips the enemy to another mode; which may or may not be desirable. </p>
    <li>Cargo Trailer. A Blue pip Utility that can boost an attack by 1, 4, or 9; if you can get them all played. As you can only one each turn, it may be too slow. </p>
    <li>Team-Up Tactics. A blue-pip 2 heal for Grapple (with value for Cars if you have those in the deck). </p>
</ol>

<p>Remember, all of those cards can only be played while Grapple is in Truck mode. There's not a huge amount there that speaks to Grapple; and having cards with only 1 pip color will get in the way of Grapple's bot effect. When we look for partners, let's remember that we're not focusing on the Truck trait. </p>


<p>How about Melee?</p>

<p class="cmd">Click on the "Text contains 'truck'" filter and change the entry to '<u>Melee</u>'. </p>

<p>This gives us 10 results, 2 of which are Characters that we can ignore:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Wedge Formation mentions Melee, but it mentions the other two traits too (Ranged and Specialist). It's an Orange/Black/Green pipped card, which may be useful.</li>
    <li> Tackle, Energon Slingshot, and Sturdy Javelin are two single-color pip cards with little special value for Grapple.</li>
    <li> Body Armor (Orange pip, Tough 3) and Power Sword (Blue pip, Bold 3) are of interest. They are single pipped, but they would help Grapple in his hunt for pippage.</li>
    <li> Covert Armor and Reflex Circuits are both Blue/Green; though only Covert Armor is actually for Melee. Reflex Circuits is used against Melee characters. </li>
</ol>

<p>So apart from a couple of possibles, the world of Melee cards also fails to give us any Aha moments in building for Grapple. Let's add the interesting ones to our deck so we don't forget them. Click on the Deck section on the left hand side; typically I would click on it twice as the first click on the Deck title bar will roll up the contents. Then let's double click on Wedge Formation, Body Armr, Power Sword, and Covert Armor. Let's only put the 1 of each in for now to remind ourselves that we weren't committing to these cards.  </p>

<h4>Step 4: Looking for more synergy</h4>

<p>Grapple likes his battle icons. Before we go any further, let's see if we can find any other characters that also like their battle icons. Perhaps there will be some synergy.</p>
<p class="cmd">Click on the "Text contains 'melee'" filter and change that to 'color'. </p>
<p>Ignoring Wave 5, our results are Espionage, Windblade - Combiner Hunter, Airquake Hammerclaw, Raider Ratbat, and Lucky Vest. Some of these look interesting: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Espionage - The least interesting as it has to do with the color of pips in your opponent's deck.</li>
    <li>Windblade - 12 star Windblade can flip to play the top card of the deck if it has 2 different battle icon colors. </li>
    <li>Airquake Hammerclaw - You're forgiven if this card is causing a little befuddlement. This is the upgrade mode of Private Smashdown, where our desire for flipping 4-colors gives us a fair chance of turning Private Smashdown's upgrade mode into a +4 weapon. </li>
    <li>Raider Ratbat - In bot mode, 6 star Ratbat can tap to repair his team for the number of battle icons shown. Jumping ahead on battle icons a little, we're likely to be running a lot of multi-color cards, so Ratbat becomes a reliable heal-2 for each character. </li>
    <li>Lucky Vest - This battle card contains no battle icons, which will be a negative for our deck, however its effect is a perfect fit. Whenever at least four battle icons are shown, the character can't take more than 4 attack damage in the battle. Unlikely most protections like this (Force Field, Emergency Defense Field, and XYZ jumping to mind), Lucky Vest isn't scrapped after the battle. </li>
</ul>

<p>So we don't forget them, let's double clck on Lucky Vest to add it to the deck, then click on Sideboard on the left hand side (a couple of times to stop it hiding), and click on Airquake Hammerclaw and Raider Ratbat. Let's avoid Windblade; for the feature her 12 stars are a hefty cost. </p>

<p>Searching for 'color' was easy. What about a card which talks specifically about battle pips? We don't have battle icon color keys on our keyboards, so searching for these is harder. Let's reuse the color filter and modify it to say '[W]'. Then, let's click on the Text filter-menu item again and type in '[O]'. We now have two filters on the same column, allowing us to see any card that mentions a White or an Orange battle icon. Mostly you'll see character cards; all of whom require sets of White/Orange/Blue, along with the 1 star battle card Fuel Cache and Overwhelming Advantage. The characters listed are Metroplex (25 Stars), Bluestreak, Optimus Prime - Gleaming Commander, Silverbolt, Private Red Alert, and (Wave 5) Cerebros. Metroplex and Cerebros are out, Optimus is focused on being a Combiner, but the others may be an optional should we decide on a deck that has White, Orange, Blue icons. Red Alert and Bluestreak are both mini-versions of Grapple and may enjoy a deck with high battle icon count flips.  Let's add Red Alert and Bluestreak as options to our Sideboard section. Let's also put a Fuel Cache and an Overwhelming Advantage in there as possibles. </p>

<p>If you do searches for Green ([G]) and Black ([Bl] or [K] my fault), you'll see that outside of Overwhelming Advantage, there aren't any cards that have effects relying on the mix of those pips with something else. There are still items to consider here. Combiner Swoop and Private Greenlight both like green pips, while Nova Storm and Nightstick are affordable black battle icon characters. Let's add them to our shopping basket; I mean sideboard. </p>


<h4>Step 4: Ponder the Battle Icons</h4>

<p>We now have a sideboard full of possible synergies, but we haven't decided what our battle icon strategy will be. This deck is about Grapple, and having Grapple as an 8 Attack/4 Defense character cwwill be huge. We will want to ensure we have a high chance of getting his Bot mode effect every time. This raises two questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Do we include 4 pip colors, or do we have 5 and risk getting a color too many?</li>
    <li>If we only do 4 pip colors, which color do we drop?</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems pretty obvious that we won't want to ignore White pip cards. An Orange/Black/Green/Blue deck seems like punishment. I look forward to seeing Blues on Attack do this at some time in the future. It also seems obvious that we're going to want to think about 2-mixed-pip cards instead of building a deck of single-battle-icon cards and hoping. </p>

<p>Let's take a look at the battle cards that have a White battle icon.</p>

<p class="cmd">Open up a new tab. Filter out the Wave 5 cards as above, then filter out Characters by using a Filter: Type option, typing 'char' but setting the drop down to "Does Not Contain".</p>
<p class="cmd">Click on Filter: White Pips and type 1 (you could look for Greater or Equal, but you probably know as well as I do that there are no cards with two White pips).</p>
<p class="cmd">If you sort by Orange Pip, you will see that there are two cards with Orange and White (and Blue). These are both star cards. Of these, Fuel Cache is one to consider if we need a star card and have chosen to include white, orange and blue in our deck.</p>
<p class="cmd">Sorting by Blue Pip you will see the same two cards are shown.</p>
<p class="cmd">Sorting by Black Pips, you will see that Swerve is the only white/black battle card. It's a secret action that flips you to alt when you defend; which isn't in Grapple's interest.</p>
<p class="cmd">Lastly, you'll notice a lot of Green Pips. Let's focus on those. Setting Filter: Green Pip to 1, we see 9 battle cards in Wave 1-4.</p>

<p>White/Green looks very interesting for Grapple.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to filter on pips, let's jump to an already prepared list of W1-4 double pip different-colour non-star battle cards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>BG: 12</li>
    <li>WG: 9</li>
    <li>OG: 8</li>
    <li>OK: 8</li>
    <li>BK: 5</li>
    <li>GK: 5</li>
    <li>OB: 2</li>
    <li>WK: 1</li>
</ul>


<p>This includes a little duplication in that the three-icon'd Wedge Formation (OGK) appears in both the OK and OG lines.</p>

<p>If we make the hypothesis that WG is better than plain W, we are pushed towards one of three possibilites to complete our 4 battle icon colours.</p>

<ul>
    <li>WG+OK</li>
    <li>WG+BK</li>
    <li>WG+OB</li>
</ul>

<p>If we only care about hitting Grapple's effect every time via standard 2 card flips and using WG cards, we peak at a 74% chance of achieving the effect with 23 White Green pips in our deck. With a max of 27 WG cards available, there are just about enough in W1-4 to achieve this. We will also need 15 other cards, which there are enough of in each of the OK and BK sets, but not the OB set. If we have Bold 1 or Tough 1, our 23 WG remains our peak and sees us hitting the effect 88% of the time, while Bold 2/Tough 2 gets the effect 95% of the time. </p>

<p>Note that the two black battle icon options also have the option of including the WK card and bringing in an OG or BG coloured card, though it will cost us some Grapple success (dropping 5 percentage points of successfully hitting Grapple's effect).</p>

<p>Let's say we ignore the WG guess earlier and just use W cards with OB, OG, and BG. Our best is 30% chance at W2:38:2 OG19:1:1 BG19:1:1 or 36% with W2:26:2 OB6 OG16:4:1 BG16:4:1.</p>

<p>So 23 WG cards is the thing. OK is there - it can provide up to 24 cards. BK isn't quite there, it can only provide 15 cards, forcing us to increase our WG number to 25. That only costs us 1% point of Grapple effect. OB is not there; by only providing 6 cards it leaves us hanging with only 27 WG cards. Let's say we go with OO6BB4OB6WG26, our Grapple fun level is noly 44%.</p>

<p>Another approach. If we split the rest of the deck between OK and BK, we get a 53% chance of hitting Grapple's effect at 27 WG cards.</p>

<p>So great; we can guarantee some hefty Grapple power with either a lot of WG cards, along with some OK cards or some BK cards. There are some issues here:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We have a very limited selection of cards. </li>
    <li>With 8 attack each time, Grapple is never using those pierce flips. Additionally, the high number of WG cards means each character is typically flipping one O or one B each turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming we go with the math answer, let's look at our cards:</p>

<p><u>OK Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Combat Dagger (Weapon: Bold 1)</li>
    <li>Rock Toss (Action: 1 Damage Tapped)</li>
    <li>Composite Armor (Armor: Tank only)</li>
    <li>Fight for Position (Action: Bold 2)</li>
    <li>Immersed in Shadow (Utility: Untapped Stealth)</li>
    <li>Opportune Repairs (Action: Autobot Healing w/ Mercenary)</li>
    <li>Terrifying Resilience (Armor: Decepticon Tough 2)</li>
    <li>Wedge Formation (Action: Heal/Draw/Plan). Grapple would get a Heal.</li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Escape Capsule, Lose The Initiative, Magnetic Dysfunction Ray, Master of Metallikato and Precision Fire are all good adds]</p>

<p><u>BK Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Smoke Cloak (Armor: Tough 1)</li>
    <li>Steady Shot (Action: +2 Attack)</li>
    <li>Opportune Offensive (Action: +3 Decepticon ATK/Pierce w/ Mercenary)</li>
    <li>Point Position (Utility: Tapped Bravery)</li>
    <li>Unflinching Courage (Weapon: Autobot Bold 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Master of Metallikato, Scout Armor, Scouting Mission are great adds]</p>

<p><u>WG Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Attack Drone (Weapon: +1 Attack)</li>
    <li>Decepticon Crown (Utility: Plan 1)</li>
    <li>Escape Route (Action: Bot-&gt;Alt). Great card for Grapple.</li>
    <li>Espionage (Action: Scrap)</li>
    <li>Inverted! (Utility: Flip O-&gt;B, B-&gt;O)</li>
    <li>Secret Dealings (Action: Draw. Plan)</li>
    <li>Spare Parts (Utility: Protect Scrapping)</li>
    <li>Backup Bag (Utility: Protect Scrapping)</li>
    <li>Personal Targeting Drone (Utility: Pierce. Scrapping on scrap). </li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Hold The Line, Mission Briefing, Paralyzo Box and Speed Trap are all great]</p>

<p>That's a lot of Utilities!</p>

<p>So what else do we know from this all about Grapple list? For one, we are going to be flipping two white and two green on most flips. So let's go back to the list of characters who like whites and greens.</p>

<p>Now would be a great time for the Air Strike Patrol; but as they're nasty little nippers they're out of this competition. On the Green side this leaves us Combiner Swoop or Radier Chop Shop. Neither offer that much. The White pip world is a different affair however:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Vanguard [5 Star]. Whenever anyone else flips 1 [W], damage is limited to 5.</li>
    <li>Seawatch and the Rescue Patrol will get to flip 7 cards when they hit 2 whites. That gives them 3 of the Orange or Blue on each battle. At 12 stars, Grapple is leaving space for a Rescue Patrol team up, or maybe only Seawatch makes the team. </li>
    <li>Combiner Slug [8 Star] gets an extra flip when he hits a white in battling. That gets him an extra 1 Orange or Blue. </li>
    <li>Wave 1 Chromia [8 Star] can draw 2 cards when she flips two white pip in an attack. </li>
    <li>Wave 1's Skywarp [6 Star] can shift damage off of himself.</li>
    <li>Autobot Mirage [9 Star] gets to untap when he gets 3 hits in. 9 Stars is probably too expensive however.</li>
    <li>Autobot Jazz [6 Star] gets additional Pierce when attacking, and can't take more than 2 damage when defending if the opponent doesn't have Pierce.</li>
    <li>Autobot Hound [8 Star] becomes a 5/3 when he flips a white in bot mode, and can scrap 1/draw 2 when flipping back to alt.</li>
    <li>Private Pteraxadon [6 Star] who turns into a +3 weapon that removes the defender's base defence on two whites.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot to consider there. For their cost Vanguard and Seawatch are great, but both together leaves us 3 stars short. We don't have the greatest options no star cards, so let's assume only one of them makes the team. </p>

<p>Let's compare some of these characters. Hound (5/3 in Bot Mode, 12 Health) has better stats in this deck than Slug (3/3 with 10 Health). Autobot Jazz can be good in ideal circumstances, however pierce is prominent enough now that he is more likely to be a weakness. Skywarp's damage shifting would be easy to pull off, and we could include somebody like 5-Star Motormaster so the damage on Skywarp gets shifted over to Grapple and go nowhere, or it could be sent into 6 star Pteraxadon. With Point Position in the deck we could even get Skywarp feeling a little Brave. This would leave us 2 Stars short, but there may be a concept there. Lastly, Chromia's 4/2 with 11 Health is weaker than Autobot Hound, especially as it becomes 4/0 in her card draw mode. </p>

<p>This leaves us with 3 interesting White pip based decks for Grapple:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Seawatch and the Rescue Patrol (Stakeout and Fixit).</li>
    <li> Autobot Hound and either Vanguard or Seawatch.</li>
    <li> Skywarp and Motormaster.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also had some interesting Green/Black thoughts earlier on. Private Greenlight would, assuming we play two WG cards, attack for 6, and her Safeguard 3 is a nice start. Lastly, her Upgrade holding would be good if paired with a Battle Master. Smashdown's icon color counting fits with Grapple. Ratbat's healing may be valuable, but his 6 star cost is a poor fit for our options. Nightstick and Nova Storm seem less valuable. So updating our team possibilities:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Seawatch, Stakeout and Fixit.</li>
    <li> Autobot Hound or Private Greenlight. Vanguard, Seawatch, or Smashdown.</li>
    <li> Skywarp and Motormaster.</li>
</ol>

<p>In thinking of a sideboard with the above, the overlap between #1 and #2 above does suggest a Rescue Patrol deck with Autobot Hound on the bench; given that it's assumed Grapple must always be on the battlefield for the competition. Alternatively, going two wide with a 13 star character might be an option. Given the battle cards above, Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend's attack ability to play a flipped Action would be poor. There are few weapons for Megatron - Living Weapon, and limited playable upgrades for General Megatron. Octone is a possibility as we have the Autobot healing card as a potential, while, bizarrely, Starscream - Decepticon King may be the best of the 13 stars (feel free to take a short pause to recover from reading that statement). The three Decepticon Crown's could be in the deck, and there's also Secret Dealings with Plan in the deck. </p>

<p>In terms of sideboard cards, one option would be to flip from a WGOK deck to WGBK, or the other way. If moving from WGOK to WGBK, this leaves 7 OK cards in the deck and Grapple's chances are only 50%. If moving from WGBK to WGOK, the lack of BK cards means there would only be 5 BK cards in the deck and Grapple's chances go up to 55%.</p>

<p>The above is all very pip focused. Let's say we don't care about our partners getting value from the deck, and instead just focus on support for Grapple. In that case we might consider a Brave character like Fireflight or Headstrong to take first hits, and a solid 8 Star partner. Autobot Hound would still be an option, as would Mudflap (if going OK, allowing for Opportune Repairs). The excellently vanilla Wave 1 Bombshell is a potent partner, or, for kicks, you could choose Slipstream or Private Sideswipe from previous Back to the Binder challenges. </p>

<p>The battle card sideboard thinking above was also very pip-focused. What cards could we add that don't fit our pip-setup but still add value? Wave 4 provided us with three White battle icon focused cards in Acute Reflexes (W icon; Focus 1 when flipping a W), Adaptive Plating (B icon; +2 defence on flipping a W), and Erratic Cannon (O icon; +3 attack on flipping a W).</p>

<p>So which team shall I go with?</p>

<p>First let's make the decision on OK or BK. The extra 2 OK pips will be additional damage for Grapple, as it's unlikely an enemy will defend for 8, however they will be of much less value for Grapple's partners who will do the same damage with them that they would do with 2 BK pips. The extra 2 BK pips however would be of value for everyone when defending when not up against pierce decks. On the BK side, 3 of the 5 BK cards are playable, with Point Position being a fairly playable 4th. Of the 15 OK cards that would be included, 4 are very playable, with Immersed in Shadow being a less useful alternative to Point position at #5.</p>

<p>Grapple is low Health wise, so we need to protect him. This leans towards a BK option. </p>

<p>I've been mentioning various percentages and math likelihoods as if I am some kind of flipping savant (see what I did there? Pun!). I won't pretend to be such. For one, there is Computron's Labs <a href="https://www.computronslab.com/grapple">excellent article on Grapple</a>, which at time of writing was dated (though at time of editing I notice it's been morphed into an entry for this challenge). Given the article was dated though, and because I've wanted to spend some time thinking about how to do pip-flipping-research; I present <a href="https://www.freelancepeacekeeping.com/pippalizer/">Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer</a>, a tool that I hope everybody gets some value from. </p>

<p>Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer is a webpage that let's you simulate card flips in decks. There are a couple of ways to describe your deck's battle-card setup, either via GUI or a pip pattern. You can vary the deck setup that the tool should run through. For example, you might want to know the percentage of times you will flip exactly 4 colours while varying the number of WG cards from 16 to 27, while varying the number of OK cards from 24 down to 13. Please give it a play; feedback is much appreciated. </p>

<p>Hopefully that was fun :)</p>

<p>So... who makes the team?</p>

<p>Let's keep holding that off for the moment. While we have a mathematically great deck, it has some dead cards if you have 25 WGs, namely the, presumably 4, Decepticon Crown and Backup Bag cards. Let's assume we're going to get rid of them for now. Running the Flippalizer, we get the following percentages for Grapple-Success for 21WG and 15BK plus the listed pips:</p>


<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
WK4	71%
W4	71%
G2W2	69%
W3OK1	68%
B2W2	67%
W3OO1	65%
G2B2	65%
B4	64%
W1OKG3	64%
OK2W2	63%
W2OK2	62%
O2W2	58%
OK4	54%
OB4	54%
O4	47%
X4	47%
</pre>

<p>We can see that replacing WG cards with W cards (or WK, or feasibly WB if they existed) has the least impact, losing us only 2 percentage points of Grapple-success. At the other end of the spectrum we see that bringing in Orange is costly, as costly no-pip cards. It makes sense that replacing WG cards with cards that have W pips on, but not O, is best, with cards that have G pips on, but not O, runs in second place. Here's what that looks like:</p>


<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
W4	71%  (or WK)
W2G2	68%
G4	65%
BG4	64%
WOB4	56%
</pre>

<p>Given these numbers, let's look to the White and Green pipped cards. We could look to WK, but the only W1-4 WK card is Swerve, and we are only rarely going to want to flip Grapple to alt mode before he's attacked.</p>

<p>One issue with the world of WG cards is that there are no Armors and little in the way of scrapping. Let's opt for 2 W Armors, and 2 G scrapping cards. W Armors typically is a choice between Force Field and Medic's Protective Field - with Medic's feeling like it's been more popular since it came out. Let's go with Medic's, though looking to Wave 5, there is a lot of 'do-1-damage' going on, so I feel we'll want to switch back to Force Field for a Wave 5 deck. For scrapping, Wave 4's Reprocess is the card of choice due to its huge versatility. We can heal our team, scrapping one of those not-brilliant WG Utilities, or we can use it to scrap any upgrade from our opponent's deck. Another useful White pip would be Acute Reflexes, giving Grapple Focus 1, but we have a lot of Utilities already.</p>

<p>We've lost 5 percentage points of Grapple success doing this, but we've gained a couple of features for our deck. If we go back to the numbers and consider a full set of these, we see that it only costs us 2 more percentage points to include W3G3 cards instead of W2G2. Let's ditch a couple more WG cards and be happy with our 66% chance of pulling off Grapple's effect when flipping 2 unknown cards (i.e. we can make it better with Tough, Bold, and Plan). </p>

<p>So... who makes the team?</p>

<p>I really like Autobot Hound. He's a mini-Grapple and if with Smashdown on he can be a 9-attack threat. I like that this might be a time for the Rescue Patrol, but sadly as it's not a White icon focused Deck I don't think it works out for them. That also leans things away from Seawatch towards Vanguard or Smashdown. As your opponent gets to play cards before an Armor is useful, but has to play Sabotage Armaments before a Weapon is used, you are more likely to get value from a weapon. To this end, and because Smashdown feels very underused, I'm going to go with Private Smashdown. For a Sideboard I'm going to go Octone. He and Grapple side by side would change the deck up a touch, and bringing in some OK cards like Opportune Repairs feels powerful.</p>

<p>In terms of cards, I would drop the Point Position, Opportune Offensive, and perhaps surprisingly, the Unflinching Courage. Bold won't do much more than get a little more unused Pierce, even though Octone and Grapple would both be able to use upgrade with Unflinching Courage. </p>

<p>Here's a link to the Deck. I've called it: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-vDeqg9TZ9Vt">Grappling With Maths</a>. </p>

<p>One of the problems in building a deck with W1-4 is that there aren't quite enough cards to be fully happy with each card you have. Wave 5 provides a lot of good WG and BK cards, so I've also uploaded a deck that is purer on the maths, while avoiding utterly dead cards: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-w5-oH51SA_OPTb">Grappling With Maths W5</a>. </p>
