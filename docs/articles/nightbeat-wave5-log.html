<h1>Nightbeat's Wave 5 Log</h1>
<h3>2019/12/19 -> 2020/01/31</h3>

<h4>Date +20191219:</h4>

<p>While hunting for a missing bot named Air-Ess, I have chanced upon an anonymous <a href="https://twitter.com/TransformersTCG/status/1207748334238105600">forum posting</a> indicating a new wave of Cybertonians are arriving in 150 cycles. Information is low and I will need to investigate, though the streets are low on gossip. My usual sources are curiously distracted, though some have been muttering about Tight-Hans. Sounds like a henchbot of some kind. </p>

<h4>Date +20200130:</h4>

<p>Via an over-talkative shopkeeper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transformers-TCG-Masters-Booster-Fortress/dp/B0848KW42P/">source</a>, I have received confirmation of the forthcoming arrival of a new Wave of Cybertronians. Hushed whispers talk of Titans, Wreckers, and Stratagems. Old rusty himself, Sergeant Kup, is spoken of, as is, must be compensating for something, Fortress Maximus. </p>

<p>A newsspeaker has leaked further <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-transformers-tcg-titan-masters-attack-packs-bring-fortress-maximus-to-the-playfield">information</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Large deployments of the wave will come with Fortress Maximus, Cerebus, and Emissary (Presumably 25 Stars).</li>
    <li>Each booster unit will contain either a Titan Master Body and Head, or a typical Large Cybertronian along with a Stratagem. </li>
    <li>Titan Master <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/sergeant-kup-wrecker-leader-TMA">Sergeant Kup</a> (7 Star) has been identified, along with his head <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/flintlock--TMA">Flintlock</a> (4 Star). Kup (Leader/Truck/Wrecker) is Tough; real Tough. He's also the leader of the Wreckers and always useful in a Scrap. </li>
    <li>The first of thirty Stratagems has been identified. <a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/article_attachments/360048666351/5.jpg">Orbital Strike</a> (1 Star) will boost Cosmos's powers so he can take on all but the largest bots. </li>
</ul>

<p>The timing is odd, are the shopkeeper and the newsspeaker working together? I must keep my eye on them. </p>

<p>I have deduced that there will be 46 Cybertronians. Will one be the missing Air-Ess?</p>

<p>A mole on the inside of the wave deployment authority indicates there will be an announcement tomorrow. </p>

<h4>Date +20200131:</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039009692-Nagle-s-Notes-When-Titans-Attack">announcement</a> was made by the authority's usual humanoid facsimile. Presumably it is trustworthy, though you have to be a little paranoid with these facsimiles. You never know when they will turn out to be a hologram. Said announcement stated:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Titan Masters require a Body and a Head. The Head's effect apply in both Alt and Bot mode. </li>
    <li>Once the Bot is KO'd, the Head flips to Bot mode and keeps on fighting. All Upgrades are lost, though there are rumours of a way around this. </li>
    <li>Heads are 1 to 4 Stars. </li>
    <li>Once they are separate they never rejoin, and headless Bodies can't return from the KO area. </li>
    <li>A second Stratagem was introduced named <a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/article_attachments/360048666131/4.jpg">Swap Heads</a> that allows two bots to flip their heads once. </li>
</ul>

<p>On Stratagems: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Stratagems cost 1 or more Stars. </li>
    <li>You can only have one of each at a time. </li>
    <li>Many can only be used once. </li>
    <li>They are a new format, neither battle nor character card. </li>
    <li>Common Stratagems help a bot in Wave 5. </li>
    <li>Uncommon Stratagems help a team (Wave 5 only?). </li>
    <li>Rare Stratagems typically help a non-Wave 5 bot. </li>
</ul>

<p>It also leaked more information, providing the identity of another member of the Wave:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/twin-twist-demolitions-TMA">Twin Twist</a> (9 Star) and his Head <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/card/flameout--TMA">Flameout</a> (3 Star). Bold Twin Twist (Tank/Wrecker) will be bringing his trademark flipping and piercing abilities to play. </li>
</ul>

<p>There's a lot of chatter on the street, but my usual sources seem to be lost in speculation. I haven't yet been able to identify the number of Titan Master's arriving, or if they will have equal numbers of Heads and Bodies. The mole has leaked that booster units of Titan Masters will not contain Heads and Bodies that typically go together. This sounds like typical deployment authority inefficiencies at play; perhaps they think this is a game?</p>

<p class="commentary">"I always find that separating heads and bodies is easy; keeping track of which one went with which, not so easy, yes?"</p>
