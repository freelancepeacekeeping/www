<h1>Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer - And the Deck</h1>
<h3>2020.04.26</h3>

<p>We've <a href="grapple.html">learned a little about Grapple</a>, <a href="grapple2.html">learned how to use the OCTGN Deck Editor</a>, and <a href="grapple3.html">spent some time thinking about battle icon math</a>. Now let's discover a new tool and get to our conclusion, the Grapple Deck. </p>

<p>I've been mentioning various percentages and math likelihoods as if I am some kind of flipping savant (see what I did there? Pun!). I won't pretend to be such. For one, there is Computron's Labs <a href="https://www.computronslab.com/grapple">excellent article on Grapple</a>, which at time of writing was dated (though at time of editing I notice it's been morphed into an entry for this challenge). Given the article was dated though, and because I've wanted to spend some time thinking about how to do pip-flipping-research; I present <a href="https://www.freelancepeacekeeping.com/pippalizer/">Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer</a>, a tool that I hope everybody gets some value from. </p>

<p>Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer is a webpage that let's you simulate card flips in decks. There are a couple of ways to describe your deck's battle-card setup, either via GUI or a pip pattern. You can vary the deck setup that the tool should run through. For example, you might want to know the percentage of times you will flip exactly 4 colours while varying the number of WG cards from 16 to 27, while varying the number of OK cards from 24 down to 13. Please give it a play; feedback is much appreciated. </p>


<p>Let's use the Pippalizer a little. While we have a mathematically great deck, it has some dead cards if you have 25 WGs, namely the, presumably 4, Decepticon Crown and Backup Bag cards. Let's assume we're going to get rid of them for now. Running the Flippalizer, we get the following percentages for Grapple-Success for 21WG and 15BK plus the listed pips:</p>

<p>By running a pip pattern of 21WG15BK plus the first column below, our results for the colours(*)=4 PIPQL are shown in the second column. </p>

<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
WK4	71%
W4	71%
G2W2	69%
W3OK1	68%
B2W2	67%
W3OO1	65%
G2B2	65%
B4	64%
W1OKG3	64%
OK2W2	63%
W2OK2	62%
O2W2	58%
OK4	54%
OB4	54%
O4	47%
X4	47%
</pre>

<p>We can see that replacing WG cards with W cards (or WK, or feasibly WB if they existed) has the least impact, losing us only 2 percentage points of Grapple-success. At the other end of the spectrum we see that bringing in Orange is costly, as costly no-pip cards. It makes sense that replacing WG cards with cards that have W pips on, but not O, is best, while cards that have G pips on, but not O, runs in second place. Let's do a few more pippalizing runs:</p>


<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
W4	71%  (or WK)
W2G2	68%
G4	65%
BG4	64%
WOB4	56%
</pre>

<p>Given these numbers, let's look to the White and Green pipped cards. We could look to WK, but the only W1-4 WK card is Swerve, and we are only rarely going to want to flip Grapple to alt mode before he's attacked.</p>

<p>One issue with the world of WG cards is that there are no Armors and little in the way of scrapping. Let's opt for 2 W Armors, and 2 G scrapping cards. W Armors typically is a choice between Force Field and Medic's Protective Field - with Medic's feeling like it's been more popular since it came out. Let's go with Medic's, though looking to Wave 5, there is a lot of 'do-1-damage' going on, so I feel we'll want to switch back to Force Field for a Wave 5 deck. For scrapping, Wave 4's Reprocess is the card of choice due to its huge versatility. We can heal our team, scrapping one of those not-brilliant WG Utilities, or we can use it to scrap any upgrade from our opponent's deck. Another useful White pip would be Acute Reflexes, giving Grapple Focus 1, but we have a lot of Utilities already.</p>

<p>We've lost 5 percentage points of Grapple success doing this, but we've gained a couple of features for our deck. If we go back to the numbers and consider a full set of these, we see that it only costs us 2 more percentage points to include W3G3 cards instead of W2G2. Let's ditch a couple more WG cards and be happy with our 66% chance of pulling off Grapple's effect when flipping 2 unknown cards (i.e. we can make it better with Tough, Bold, and Plan). </p>

<p class="commentary">You better not have Open Sourced that tool; not my style yes?</p>

<p>Hopefully that was fun :) What's more, it's <a href="https://github.com/freelancepeacekeeping/www/tree/master/docs/pippalizer">Open Sourced</a>!</p>

<p class="commentary">Minion!!!!</p>

<p>So, now that we've pippalized, who makes the team?</p>

<p>It's not the time for the Rescue Patrol. Despite all the WG cards, this is not a White deck. Vanguard would have some advantages, but Armor is harder to get value out of than Weapons (Sabotaged Armaments aside); thus our partners are Autobot Hound and Private Smashdown. I really like Autobot Hound. He's a mini-Grapple and if with Smashdown on he can be a 9-attack threat. For a Sideboard I'm going to go Octone. He and Grapple side by side would change the deck up a touch, and bringing in some O/OK cards like Opportune Repairs and Peace Through Tyranny feels powerful.</p>

<p>In terms of cards, I would drop the Point Position, Opportune Offensive, and perhaps surprisingly, the Unflinching Courage. Bold won't do much more than get a little more unused Pierce, even though Octone and Grapple would both be able to use it. </p>

<p>Here's a link to the Deck. I've called it: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-vDeqg9TZ9Vt">Grappling With Maths</a>. </p>

<p>One of the problems in building a deck with W1-4 is that there aren't quite enough cards to be fully happy with each card you have. Wave 5 provides a lot of good WG and BK cards, so I've also uploaded a deck that is purer on the maths, while avoiding utterly dead cards: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-w5-oH51SA_OPTb">Grappling With Maths W5</a>. </p>

<p>This was a long read, even longer before some rather aggressive editing. I thank even those who successfully skimmed their way through and I hope you found some value here. I especially hope that you will find value in the <a href="https://www.freelancepeacekeeping.com/pippalizer/">Flipping Pippalizer</a>, and I hope to be able to grow its feature set. </p>
