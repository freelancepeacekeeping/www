<h1>Grappling By The Numbers</h1>
<h3>2020.04.26</h3>

<p>Earlier we learned a little about Grapple on <a href="grapple.html">Grappling - Page 1 - Grapple and the Challenge</a>, and about how to use OCTGN's Deck Editor in <a href="grapple2.html">Grappling - Page 2 - </a>. Now let's look into the numbers that make up a Super Grapple deck. </p>

<h3>Choosing Our Pip Strategy</h3>

<p>Now that you know how to filter on pips, let's jump to an already prepared list of W1-4 double pip different-colour non-star battle cards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>BG: 12</li>
    <li>WG: 9</li>
    <li>OG: 8</li>
    <li>OK: 8</li>
    <li>BK: 5</li>
    <li>GK: 5</li>
    <li>OB: 2</li>
    <li>WK: 1</li>
</ul>


<p>This includes a little duplication in that the three-icon'd Wedge Formation (OGK) appears in both the OK and OG lines.</p>

<p>If we make the hypothesis that WG is better than plain W, we are pushed towards one of three possibilites to complete our 4 battle icon colours.</p>

<ul>
    <li>WG+OK</li>
    <li>WG+BK</li>
    <li>WG+OB</li>
</ul>

<p>If we only care about hitting Grapple's effect every time via standard 2 card flips and using WG cards, we peak at a 74% chance of achieving the effect with 23 White Green pips in our deck. With a max of 27 WG cards available, there are just about enough in W1-4 to achieve this. We will also need 15 other cards, which there are enough of in each of the OK and BK sets, but not the OB set. If we have Bold 1 or Tough 1, our 23 WG remains our peak and sees us hitting the effect 88% of the time, while Bold 2/Tough 2 gets the effect 95% of the time. </p>

<p>Note that the two black battle icon options also have the option of including the WK card and bringing in an OG or BG coloured card, though it will cost us some Grapple success (dropping 5 percentage points of successfully hitting Grapple's effect).</p>

<p>Let's say we ignore the WG guess earlier and just use W cards with OB, OG, and BG. Our best is 30% chance at W2:38:2 OG19:1:1 BG19:1:1 or 36% with W2:26:2 OB6 OG16:4:1 BG16:4:1.</p>

<p>So 23 WG cards is the thing. OK is there - it can provide up to 24 cards. BK isn't quite there, it can only provide 15 cards, forcing us to increase our WG number to 25. That only costs us 1% point of Grapple effect. OB is not there; by only providing 6 cards it leaves us hanging with only 27 WG cards. Let's say we go with OO6BB4OB6WG26, our Grapple fun level is noly 44%.</p>

<p>Another approach. If we split the rest of the deck between OK and BK, we get a 53% chance of hitting Grapple's effect at 27 WG cards.</p>

<p>So great; we can guarantee some hefty Grapple power with either a lot of WG cards, along with some OK cards or some BK cards. There are some issues here:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We have a very limited selection of cards. </li>
    <li>With 8 attack each time, Grapple is never using those pierce flips. Additionally, the high number of WG cards means each character is typically flipping one O or one B each turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming we go with the math answer, let's look at our cards:</p>

<p><u>OK Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Combat Dagger (Weapon: Bold 1)</li>
    <li>Rock Toss (Action: 1 Damage Tapped)</li>
    <li>Composite Armor (Armor: Tank only)</li>
    <li>Fight for Position (Action: Bold 2)</li>
    <li>Immersed in Shadow (Utility: Untapped Stealth)</li>
    <li>Opportune Repairs (Action: Autobot Healing w/ Mercenary)</li>
    <li>Terrifying Resilience (Armor: Decepticon Tough 2)</li>
    <li>Wedge Formation (Action: Heal/Draw/Plan). Grapple would get a Heal.</li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Escape Capsule, Lose The Initiative, Magnetic Dysfunction Ray, Master of Metallikato and Precision Fire are all good adds]</p>

<p><u>BK Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Smoke Cloak (Armor: Tough 1)</li>
    <li>Steady Shot (Action: +2 Attack)</li>
    <li>Opportune Offensive (Action: +3 Decepticon ATK/Pierce w/ Mercenary)</li>
    <li>Point Position (Utility: Tapped Bravery)</li>
    <li>Unflinching Courage (Weapon: Autobot Bold 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Master of Metallikato, Scout Armor, Scouting Mission are great adds]</p>

<p><u>WG Cards</u></p>

<ul>
    <li>Attack Drone (Weapon: +1 Attack)</li>
    <li>Decepticon Crown (Utility: Plan 1)</li>
    <li>Escape Route (Action: Bot-&gt;Alt). Great card for Grapple.</li>
    <li>Espionage (Action: Scrap)</li>
    <li>Inverted! (Utility: Flip O-&gt;B, B-&gt;O)</li>
    <li>Secret Dealings (Action: Draw. Plan)</li>
    <li>Spare Parts (Utility: Protect Scrapping)</li>
    <li>Backup Bag (Utility: Protect Scrapping)</li>
    <li>Personal Targeting Drone (Utility: Pierce. Scrapping on scrap). </li>
</ul>

<p>[W5: Hold The Line, Mission Briefing, Paralyzo Box and Speed Trap are all great]</p>

<p>That's a lot of Utilities!</p>

<p>So what else do we know from this all about Grapple list? For one, we are going to be flipping two white and two green on most flips. So let's go back to the list of characters who like whites and greens.</p>

<p>Now would be a great time for the Air Strike Patrol; but as they're nasty little nippers they're out of this competition. On the Green side this leaves us Combiner Swoop or Radier Chop Shop. Neither offer that much. The White pip world is a different affair however:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Vanguard [5 Star]. Whenever anyone else flips 1 [W], damage is limited to 5.</li>
    <li>Seawatch and the Rescue Patrol will get to flip 7 cards when they hit 2 whites. That gives them 3 of the Orange or Blue on each battle. At 12 stars, Grapple is leaving space for a Rescue Patrol team up, or maybe only Seawatch makes the team. </li>
    <li>Combiner Slug [8 Star] gets an extra flip when he hits a white in battling. That gets him an extra 1 Orange or Blue. </li>
    <li>Wave 1 Chromia [8 Star] can draw 2 cards when she flips two white pip in an attack. </li>
    <li>Wave 1's Skywarp [6 Star] can shift damage off of himself.</li>
    <li>Autobot Mirage [9 Star] gets to untap when he gets 3 hits in. 9 Stars is probably too expensive however.</li>
    <li>Autobot Jazz [6 Star] gets additional Pierce when attacking, and can't take more than 2 damage when defending if the opponent doesn't have Pierce.</li>
    <li>Autobot Hound [8 Star] becomes a 5/3 when he flips a white in bot mode, and can scrap 1/draw 2 when flipping back to alt.</li>
    <li>Private Pteraxadon [6 Star] who turns into a +3 weapon that removes the defender's base defence on two whites.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot to consider there. For their cost Vanguard and Seawatch are great, but both together leaves us 3 stars short. We don't have the greatest options no star cards, so let's assume only one of them makes the team. </p>

<p>Let's compare some of these characters. Hound (5/3 in Bot Mode, 12 Health) has better stats in this deck than Slug (3/3 with 10 Health). Autobot Jazz can be good in ideal circumstances, however pierce is prominent enough now that he is more likely to be a weakness. Skywarp's damage shifting would be easy to pull off, and we could include somebody like 5-Star Motormaster so the damage on Skywarp gets shifted over to Grapple and go nowhere, or it could be sent into 6 star Pteraxadon. With Point Position in the deck we could even get Skywarp feeling a little Brave. This would leave us 2 Stars short, but there may be a concept there. Lastly, Chromia's 4/2 with 11 Health is weaker than Autobot Hound, especially as it becomes 4/0 in her card draw mode. </p>

<p>This leaves us with 3 interesting White pip based decks for Grapple:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Seawatch and the Rescue Patrol (Stakeout and Fixit).</li>
    <li> Autobot Hound and either Vanguard or Seawatch.</li>
    <li> Skywarp and Motormaster.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also had some interesting Green/Black thoughts earlier on. Private Greenlight would, assuming we play two WG cards, attack for 6, and her Safeguard 3 is a nice start. Lastly, her Upgrade holding would be good if paired with a Battle Master. Smashdown's icon color counting fits with Grapple. Ratbat's healing may be valuable, but his 6 star cost is a poor fit for our options. Nightstick and Nova Storm seem less valuable. So updating our team possibilities:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Seawatch, Stakeout and Fixit.</li>
    <li> Autobot Hound or Private Greenlight. Vanguard, Seawatch, or Smashdown.</li>
    <li> Skywarp and Motormaster.</li>
</ol>

<p>In thinking of a sideboard with the above, the overlap between #1 and #2 above does suggest a Rescue Patrol deck with Autobot Hound on the bench; given that it's assumed Grapple must always be on the battlefield for the competition. Alternatively, going two wide with a 13 star character might be an option. Given the battle cards above, Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend's attack ability to play a flipped Action would be poor. There are few weapons for Megatron - Living Weapon, and limited playable upgrades for General Megatron. Octone is a possibility as we have the Autobot healing card as a potential, while, bizarrely, Starscream - Decepticon King may be the best of the 13 stars (feel free to take a short pause to recover from reading that statement). The three Decepticon Crown's could be in the deck, and there's also Secret Dealings with Plan in the deck. </p>

<p>In terms of sideboard cards, one option would be to flip from a WGOK deck to WGBK, or the other way. If moving from WGOK to WGBK, this leaves 7 OK cards in the deck and Grapple's chances are only 50%. If moving from WGBK to WGOK, the lack of BK cards means there would only be 5 BK cards in the deck and Grapple's chances go up to 55%.</p>

<p>The above is all very pip focused. Let's say we don't care about our partners getting value from the deck, and instead just focus on support for Grapple. In that case we might consider a Brave character like Fireflight or Headstrong to take first hits, and a solid 8 Star partner. Autobot Hound would still be an option, as would Mudflap (if going OK, allowing for Opportune Repairs). The excellently vanilla Wave 1 Bombshell is a potent partner, or, for kicks, you could choose Slipstream or Private Sideswipe from previous Back to the Binder challenges. </p>

<p>The battle card sideboard thinking above was also very pip-focused. What cards could we add that don't fit our pip-setup but still add value? Wave 4 provided us with three White battle icon focused cards in Acute Reflexes (W icon; Focus 1 when flipping a W), Adaptive Plating (B icon; +2 defence on flipping a W), and Erratic Cannon (O icon; +3 attack on flipping a W).</p>

<p>So which team shall I go with?</p>

<p>First let's make the decision on OK or BK. The extra 2 OK pips will be additional damage for Grapple, as it's unlikely an enemy will defend for 8, however they will be of much less value for Grapple's partners who will do the same damage with them that they would do with 2 BK pips. The extra 2 BK pips however would be of value for everyone when defending when not up against pierce decks. On the BK side, 3 of the 5 BK cards are playable, with Point Position being a fairly playable 4th. Of the 15 OK cards that would be included, 4 are very playable, with Immersed in Shadow being a less useful alternative to Point position at #5.</p>

<p>Grapple is low Health wise, so we need to protect him. This leans towards a BK option. </p>

<p>I've been mentioning various percentages and math likelihoods as if I am some kind of flipping savant (see what I did there? Pun!). I won't pretend to be such. For one, there is Computron's Labs <a href="https://www.computronslab.com/grapple">excellent article on Grapple</a>, which at time of writing was dated (though at time of editing I notice it's been morphed into an entry for this challenge). Given the article was dated though, and because I've wanted to spend some time thinking about how to do pip-flipping-research; I present <a href="https://www.freelancepeacekeeping.com/pippalizer/">Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer</a>, a tool that I hope everybody gets some value from. </p>

<p>Grapple's Flipping Pippalizer is a webpage that let's you simulate card flips in decks. There are a couple of ways to describe your deck's battle-card setup, either via GUI or a pip pattern. You can vary the deck setup that the tool should run through. For example, you might want to know the percentage of times you will flip exactly 4 colours while varying the number of WG cards from 16 to 27, while varying the number of OK cards from 24 down to 13. Please give it a play; feedback is much appreciated. </p>

<p>.... intermission ....</p>

<p>Hopefully that was fun :)</p>

<p>So... who makes the team?</p>

<p>Let's keep holding that off for the moment. While we have a mathematically great deck, it has some dead cards if you have 25 WGs, namely the, presumably 4, Decepticon Crown and Backup Bag cards. Let's assume we're going to get rid of them for now. Running the Flippalizer, we get the following percentages for Grapple-Success for 21WG and 15BK plus the listed pips:</p>


<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
WK4	71%
W4	71%
G2W2	69%
W3OK1	68%
B2W2	67%
W3OO1	65%
G2B2	65%
B4	64%
W1OKG3	64%
OK2W2	63%
W2OK2	62%
O2W2	58%
OK4	54%
OB4	54%
O4	47%
X4	47%
</pre>

<p>We can see that replacing WG cards with W cards (or WK, or feasibly WB if they existed) has the least impact, losing us only 2 percentage points of Grapple-success. At the other end of the spectrum we see that bringing in Orange is costly, as costly no-pip cards. It makes sense that replacing WG cards with cards that have W pips on, but not O, is best, with cards that have G pips on, but not O, runs in second place. Here's what that looks like:</p>


<pre>
Pip Pattern	colours(*)=4
WG4 73%  (our current approach)
W4	71%  (or WK)
W2G2	68%
G4	65%
BG4	64%
WOB4	56%
</pre>

<p>Given these numbers, let's look to the White and Green pipped cards. We could look to WK, but the only W1-4 WK card is Swerve, and we are only rarely going to want to flip Grapple to alt mode before he's attacked.</p>

<p>One issue with the world of WG cards is that there are no Armors and little in the way of scrapping. Let's opt for 2 W Armors, and 2 G scrapping cards. W Armors typically is a choice between Force Field and Medic's Protective Field - with Medic's feeling like it's been more popular since it came out. Let's go with Medic's, though looking to Wave 5, there is a lot of 'do-1-damage' going on, so I feel we'll want to switch back to Force Field for a Wave 5 deck. For scrapping, Wave 4's Reprocess is the card of choice due to its huge versatility. We can heal our team, scrapping one of those not-brilliant WG Utilities, or we can use it to scrap any upgrade from our opponent's deck. Another useful White pip would be Acute Reflexes, giving Grapple Focus 1, but we have a lot of Utilities already.</p>

<p>We've lost 5 percentage points of Grapple success doing this, but we've gained a couple of features for our deck. If we go back to the numbers and consider a full set of these, we see that it only costs us 2 more percentage points to include W3G3 cards instead of W2G2. Let's ditch a couple more WG cards and be happy with our 66% chance of pulling off Grapple's effect when flipping 2 unknown cards (i.e. we can make it better with Tough, Bold, and Plan). </p>

<p>So... who makes the team?</p>

<p>I really like Autobot Hound. He's a mini-Grapple and if with Smashdown on he can be a 9-attack threat. I like that this might be a time for the Rescue Patrol, but sadly as it's not a White icon focused Deck I don't think it works out for them. That also leans things away from Seawatch towards Vanguard or Smashdown. As your opponent gets to play cards before an Armor is useful, but has to play Sabotage Armaments before a Weapon is used, you are more likely to get value from a weapon. To this end, and because Smashdown feels very underused, I'm going to go with Private Smashdown. For a Sideboard I'm going to go Octone. He and Grapple side by side would change the deck up a touch, and bringing in some OK cards like Opportune Repairs feels powerful.</p>

<p>In terms of cards, I would drop the Point Position, Opportune Offensive, and perhaps surprisingly, the Unflinching Courage. Bold won't do much more than get a little more unused Pierce, even though Octone and Grapple would both be able to use upgrade with Unflinching Courage. </p>

<p>Here's a link to the Deck. I've called it: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-vDeqg9TZ9Vt">Grappling With Maths</a>. </p>

<p>One of the problems in building a deck with W1-4 is that there aren't quite enough cards to be fully happy with each card you have. Wave 5 provides a lot of good WG and BK cards, so I've also uploaded a deck that is purer on the maths, while avoiding utterly dead cards: <a href="https://fortressmaximus.io/user/deck/grappling-with-maths-w5-oH51SA_OPTb">Grappling With Maths W5</a>. </p>
