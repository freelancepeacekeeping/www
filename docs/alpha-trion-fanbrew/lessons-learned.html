<h2>Retrospective on Retrogems</h2>

<p>With Wave 5, WotC created an excellent way to handle weakened characters, namely Stratagems. Stratagems allow in-game power-ups to be applied by the player instead of via new cards or errata. Colloquially, let's call them Retrogems. Wave 5 included nine retrogems, but generally they were weak or gimmicks. We all own lots of characters who have become weakened over time, can we, as a community, take what the game designers created and bring those characters back?</p>

<p>Looking at the nine Wave 5 retrogems, most of their star cost drove the character over a natural game boundary; for example a seven star to an eight star. Most of them also gave little value for the star cost. As we create retrogems, how can we do better than WotC did in Wave 5?</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Respect What Came Before</dt>
    <dd>When inheriting someone else's work, it is easy to slip into an arrogance of seeing only problems in the work, because it's hard for us to have empathy with the decisions they made. It is important to respect that they did not have the hindsight today, and to respect that they had access to information at the time that it long since lost. The upshot is that we should work with, not against, the original WotC designs. </dd>

  <dt>Aim High</dt>
  <dd>The work on the ATP Stratagems taught me that it goes better to have a strong card that needs to be made weaker, than to have a weak card that needs to somehow be stronger. Don't be afraid to start with a concept of a powerful card.</dd>

  <dt>Allow Ownersip</dt>
  <dd>When working as a group who are each working on specific cards, it is important to give each author their prerogative. It is too easy to criticise and write off an idea, or to propose your own idea over an author's original direction. Don't do this - we are all volunteers and we don't need to deal with our investment being torn down. Give feedback within the context of the author's creation. Wait to be asked before providing more broadly scoped thoughts. </dd>

  <dt>Playtesting is Key</dt>
  <dd>Without playtesting, we have no idea if a card is right. Playtesting is tough work, but it needs to be done. Fortunately, there were volunteers to help us playtest our cards. This gives us a much broader perspective than we can bring to the cards on our own. We should double down on this and do more out-sourced playtesting in the future. </dd>

  <dt>Playtesting needs Guidance</dt>
  <dd>Something we learned the hard way is that we can't guarantee that playtesting will go the direction we expect if we don't provide guidance on how we expect a card to be played. Next time, we need to give more guidance on our vision for the deck a stratagem will create. </dd>

  <dt>Short Names</dt>
  <dd>Stratagems appreciate short names. </dd>

  <dt>Self-referential Artwork</dt>
  <dd>Use the same artwork as the cards. Tempting as it is to use exciting different views of the characters, stick with the original character art to avoid confusion.</dd>

  <dt>Zero is a cost</dt>
  <dd>It's important that we approach card cost with an open mind. Zero-star stratagems are always possible. However, it is also important that we always challenge ourselves when we move away from the norm. Why is something zero stars? Is there a context for that, or should it always be zero stars? Any zero-star stratagem needs justification. </dd>

  <dt>Structured Narratives Provide Focus</dt>
  <dd>Use a structured narrative for your early ideas. Review the card, the decks it shows in, the character's canon. This can be turned into a standrd pattern for discussing stratagems, allowing for smoother communication between designers, and between designers and playtesters. This also provides relevant historical content to use in articles. </dd>
</dl>

  <dt>Lots of work</dt>
  <dd>This used to be a large part of five people's full time job. When you're volunteering your spare time, it's a LOT of work. </dd>

  <dt>Flips aren't free</dt>
  <dd>Flipping characters is the heart of the game; free extra flips should be very rarely given (think Runamuck/Runabout). In the vast majority of cases, the player needs to earn the extra flip (be it playing a battle card, being in a certain state (armoured for example), or flipping a particular battle icon combinations). </dd>
