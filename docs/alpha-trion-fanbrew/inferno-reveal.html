<p>When my family and I first started playing Transformers TCG, Inferno was the king of our early Turbo matches. Big attacks, big defense, he was a titan amongst mechanoids. As our collection developed more, he fell by the wayside. This put him high on my list for a Stratagem. </p>

<p>In addition to a powerful attack and defense, Inferno flips to alt mode to return all Upgrades on a character to their owner's hand. This is a solid disruption play; it removes the value of a Battlemaster or Weaponizer, and it can make a player who relies on Upgrades seriously unhappy. But all is not good for Inferno though. Let's look at my design notes. </p>

<div class="boxed design">

    <dt>What is Inferno’s problem?</dt>
    <dd>Inferno has great attack and defense, and his alt-flip is a solid effect, however his health is low and start cost is expensive. Perhaps more importantly, Optimus Prime Battlefield Legend (OPBL) is simply better for just 1 star more cost, with a better alt/bot ability, 3 health more, and the only negative being OPBL having one defense less in bot mode. </dd>

   <dt>Can we fix text without modifying/replacing character text?</dt>
   <dd>Yes. His alt-mode is fine, and bot-mode is vanilla giving us options. </dd>

   <dt>What is the effect of the Stratagem having a star cost?</dt>
   <dd>Two wide decks with OPBL, Nemesis Prime, and Grapple seem the most common. Pushing Inferno to 13 would cost him OPBL as a partner, and put him up against 13-star OPBL as a choice for players. </dd>

   <dt>What is the Canon?</dt>
   <dd>Inferno’s card fits the canon well. Fearless, strong fighter, rescuer of others. He has a strong relationship with Red Alert, where he’s the cautious one. </dd>
</div>

<p>So Inferno is a protector, a defender of others. My earliest ideas were for Inferno to be an white battle-icon inverse of OPBL, playing Upgrades on defense, but in our early discussions it was pointed out that playing cards on defense can cause a lot of rule and timing complexity. That was good feedback. I went back to the drawing board. </p>

<p>One of my principles for retro stratagems is to respect what came before. WotC had a design for each of their cards, so instead of adding something new, how can we build on the original idea. Sometimes that might mean fixing a stat that they were tentative about, and other times it might mean speeding up the character. With Inferno, we have an entire blank bot mode to work with. </p>

<p>The first thing that sprung to mind with Inferno was to use that bot mode to speed him up. When he defends, let's flip him back to his alt mode. He doesn't lose anything on defensively, moving from 3 Defense to 3 Defense, but it halves the number of times you need to flip cards to pull off the Upgrade disruption. Making it happen every time is too easy however, players need to work for it. As is often the case with a character, let's make that ability connect to flipped battle cards. My original thoughts were to connect things to two flipped White battle icons, tying Inferno to rescue vehicles like the Rescue Patrol, however the aim with the Alpha Trion Protocols is to aim for these cards to be played in tournaments, and I didn't want Inferno to be an oddball White-deck. Flipping a White and a Blue battle icon it is. </p>

<p>Inferno is a protector. He's a better defender, but it doesn't help if folk don't attack him. My next thought was to give him Brave. I want him to be the wall that protects his team, an early game slowdown to your opponent's plans. He's not going to last until the end of the match, but that's Inferno. </p>

<p>Lastly, despite his high defense, Inferno's lack of health is, and will continue to be, a big problem for him. He needs more. I went back and forth between three health, to match OPBL, and giving him more. Given we're making him Brave, we can't be too eager to add health. We ended up with four health. </p>

<p>With Protection, Inferno is faster, healthier, and a pain to your opponent. He will cost 13 stars, so the question is what you can do with that remaining 12 stars. Which characters can Inferno protect? Would you go two-wide by adding a 12-star character, or three-wide? As with most Blue decks, building with Inferno will be a challenge, but a Brave, defensive bot with 15 health and the ability to smash an opponent has a lot of potential. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading</p>
