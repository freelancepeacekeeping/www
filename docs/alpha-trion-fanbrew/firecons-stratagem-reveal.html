<h1>Firecons Stratagem Reveal</h1>
<h2>Alpha Trion Protocols</h2>
<h3>2021.02.17</h3>

<p>Aggressive attacking decks are one of the great extremes of the TF:TCG world. In Wave 1 we had both the Dinobots and the Insecticons, both of them all about flipping large numbers of Orange icon'd battle cards. The classic Cars decks have been about big attacks, Wave 4 gave us the Air Strike Patrol, and Wave 5 gave us the genre crushing Sky Shadow. Wave 3 however gave us the Firecons. The Firecons were... well... they left a lot to be desired. </p>

<p>As with the Dinobots, and the Insecticons, the Firecons were a tribal Trait that sought to create a crushing amount of attack. Whereas the Dinobots (3 of 5 wave 1 classics) and Insecticons (typically 4 of 5 classics) had multiple options, the Firecons had only the three characters. In an act of potential foresight, the Firecons added up to only 24 stars, leaving a star free for a battle card, or perhaps a Stratagem. A Firecons stratagem seems a very likely WotC Wave 6 Rare. </p>

<p>All three decks are about Bold, but each has their own aspects. The Dinobots have Grimlock's native Steamroll and Sludge's game-changing flip to heal all other Dinobots. The Insecticons had Skrapnel's pre-Wave-5 powerful damage-reduction, along with Kickback's damage to attack ability and Ransack's native Bold 6. The Firecons on the other hand were far more of a control deck in their characters abilities. Cindersaur can can drop 2 damage on an enemy and lets you play an extra Orange action, Flamefeather can get up to 6 base defense and give his comrades an extra Bold, and Sparkstalker gives you a 2-card draw and a bashing shield. Unlike the Dinobots and Insecticons who were all about attack, the Firecons can mess with their opponent. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the Firecons had some great natural abilities, their stats were weak by comparison. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The classic Dinobots team (Grimlock, Sludge, Swoop) had a combined 34 HP, a combined base attack of 14-16, and a defense of 6 (focusing on the modes they were likely to attack/defend in). They also had a Bold-3 flip, a Bold-2 Utility and a Bold-5 action. Plus Sludge and Grimlocks superpowers. </li>
    <li>The classic Insecticons (Barrage, Kickback, Ransack, Chop Shop) had a combined 37 HP. They had a combined base attack of 14, with a Bold 8, a defense of 5, and both the nuisance of the Swarm! card and Skrapnel as an interesting alternative to Chop Shop. </li>
    <li>The Firecons on the other hand, 33 HP, a measly attack of 10, a defence of 4, and Firecon Flame, a Bold-1 utility that, if you can get three played, gives you the effect of one Supercharge Bold 3 for an attack. Yes they had some wonderful other abilities, but that lower defense, lower health, and limited natural attack meant they were struggling to do quite as much damage as their tribal peers. In a game in which the Dinobots, and then the Insecticons, were aggro'ing uphill, the Firecons never quite found their place as their successors. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's go back however to Sparkstalker. Sparkstalker is quite interesting because, unlike their colleagues, Sparkstalker is Common. With a native attack that draws 2 cards, and a flip that removes an armor, Sparkstalker has a lot of potential for the Common-only Junkion format. In ATP-2, two new stratagems were released for Private Arcee and Sergeant Barricade, both with a focus on helping to boost them a little for Junkion. With ATP-3, the focus is on Sergeant Sparkstalker. </p>

<p>Introducing, Sparkstalker's stratagem. </p>

</figure>

<p>Sparkstalker's major issue in Junkion is that it's weak healthwise. In fact, of the three Firecons, its 10 health is the weakest. Sure it has a natural defense of 2 compared to the other Firecons' 1, but in Junkion that is unlikely to get him to needing three hits to be KO'd. Giving Sparkstalker an extra 3 health makes it a solid 9 star, where characters generally have between 12 and 14 health. </p>

<p>The Stratagem also gives Sparkstalker an extra Bold 1 and Tough 1. The Bold 1 helps it hit its attack ability to draw 2 cards, something which, outside of Mission Briefing, often takes effort in Junkion. The Tough 1 is less critical in a classic Bold deck, but this Sparkstalker can also shine in a mixed deck, and that Tough 1 could be the difference between getting another attack in. </p>

<p>That's not all. With the ATP-Junkion format, Common star cards have been introduced, and as with the Private Arcee and Sergeant Barricade stratagems, Fire and Fury encourages players to incorporate these cards by providing an extra star for a battle card. ATP-2 provided 3, and maybe we'll see more in ATP-3. </p>

<p>Unlike the ATP-2 Junkion Stratagems, ATP-3's Fire and Fury provides an option for the Constructed and Titan One formats. As you'll have noticed, I was sloppy in my earlier description. Sparkstalker doesn't get Bold 1 and Tough 1, Firecons do. This Junkion Stratagem doubles as a Firecon Tribal Stratagem. </p>

<p>Fire and Fury raises the Firecons' combined health to 36 HP. That's an improvement. The natural Bold 1 is a goodness for attacking, but more importantly it practically guarantees an aggro deck achieving Cindersaur's four Oranges to do 2 damage to an enemy. Or a less aggro deck achieving Sparkstalker's two Oranges to draw two, and then being able to use that card draw to give Cindersaur oodles of Bold for its effect. Lastly that Tough 1 now becomes huge. Flamefeather's defense just shot up. Of course, that Tough 1 will be as likeable in a mixed Firecon deck as it is in Junkion. </p>

<p>Expect to see a lot of Sparkstalker in Junkion. With this stratagem it joins only four other Junkion 9 stars (Sergeant Hound, Sergeant Skrapnel, Bumblebee Courageous Scout, and Wave 1 Slug), and its versatility of card draw and armor scrap makes it more valuable than any of the four. As a team, the Firecons become interesting again, and maybe there's a deck out there in which Sparkstalker and one of the other Firecons is joined by a 7 star Decepticon plus Villainous Spotlight?</p>

<p>Head over to ... </p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading. </p>
