<h1>Handling Lack of Clarity</h1>
<h3>2020.07.12</h3>

<p>Trading Card Games rely on interpreting very specific language to determine how to play the game. By and large the cards should be clear and have only one way to interpret their functionality, however there will always be times when it is not clear how to play a card. This will be especially true when a new wave of cards are released. </p>

<p>To achieve clarity on a card's meaning, ensure all of the below is reviewed: </p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Read the Card</b>: First, and foremost, the language on the card trumps all else. Bear in mind though that any Official Errata for that card also applies. There has not currently been any Errata (i.e. changes to the printed text of a card), though there are some printing errors that are treated as having had errata. Chief of these is that W5's Top Spin costs 9 stars. </li>
    <li><b>Scour the Rules</b>: The cards fall into the framework created by the rules of the game. These are jointly defined in the basic and expanded rules. Any lack of clarity related to 'when' something happens should scour the Expanded Rules to achieve clarity. </li>
    <li><b>Review the FAQs</b>: In addition, there are official FAQs for each card, published via either Wave FAQs or Rules Roundups. These should also be reviewed to determine clarity. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you can't find an answer, discussing the issue with others will help. This might be privately, on Reddit, on a Facebook group, or in a Discord channel. </p>

<p>If, after determining the information available, a card's meaning still lacks clarity, then the following are a suggested set of principles to apply when trying to determine the meaning of a Transformers TCG card. Loosely they equate to trying to put yourself in the shoes of the designers. How does it seem that WotC would approach the question: </p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Look for Precedence</b>: If language is unclear, look at FAQs for similar cards to see if they provide guidance on how to interpret a situation. By applying your knowledge of the cards, you can often find language or a situation that provides an analogue to the issue at hand. Be cautious with the language in Wave 1, it often shows that the design of the game had not fully coalesced. </li>
    <li><b>Determine the Effect</b>: Consider the effect on the game of the options available. If one of the options would create an over-powered situation, consider this a less likely situation. </li>
    <li><b>Favour Player Decisions</b>: If one of the options would increase the decision points for the players in the game, consider this to be more likely. </li>
    <li><b>Be Wary of Game-Breaking</b>: Consider whether one option would, later down the line, have a significantly higher risk of new characters being over-powered. </li>
    <li><b>Encourage Player Fun</b>: If one of the options would clearly increase the fun, then consider this more likely. Note that 'fun' does not mean supercharging one player's play. It means more fun for both players. For example, a gamble effect like Paralyzo Box increases the fun of the game for both players. </li>
    <li><b>Prefer Concise Rule Changes</b>: If both options would require the Rules of the game to be clarified, prefer the one that requires less changes. </li>
    <li><b>Consider MTG</b>: While Transformers TCG is an independent game from Magic the Gathering, it is worth nothing that its design is informed by the design of Magic the Gathering. There may be some issues that lack precedence in Transformers, but would be clear in MtG. If the conversation has someone who can offer that MtG clarity, don't disregard this. Yes Transformers and MtG are different games, however the Transformers Game Designers are/were MtG Designers and they have shown a propensity to similarities. </li>
</ol>

<p>These principles clearly lean towards conservative card interpretation. That's very much by intent. It is a positive for the game, and community, if a card turns out to be significantly more powerful than first interpreted to be. It is a negative, for game and community, if one turns out to be significantly less powerful than first interpreted to be. </p>
