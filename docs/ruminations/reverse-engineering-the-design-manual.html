<h1>Reverse Engineering the Design Book</h1>
<h3>2020.07.24</h3>

<p>One assumes that the WotC Design team had a long series of internal rules they used when designing. Themes for traits, algorithms for attack/health/defense, things they won't do. We need to build that. The following are some ideas towards that. </p>

<hr/>

<dt>Battle Icon Color Rules</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Outside of reprints; Only star cards get [OO], [UU], [OU], [BBB], and any triple battle icon card with [W]</li>
    <li>No quadruplet battle icon cards</li>
    <li>No [W][O] or [W][U] battle icon cards</li>
    <li>No [G][G] or [W][W]</li>
    <li>Battle Icon sort order is WOBUG</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Trait Themes</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Cars typically have 'flip to' effects for alt-mode (18/45 Cars who are 6+ stars). They are about flipping and untapping. </li>
    <li>Planes are about moving damage. They have low defense. </li>
    <li>Dinobot's are about Bold. Their alt-mode 'flip to' effects often help other Dinobots. </li>
    <li>Tanks have high defense (2-3). </li>
    <li>Leaders are Leaders in all modes. "Chromia, Special Ops"" is the exception, but that seems like an error. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Statistics</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NcLXmDl2HfPrm2wyqlq3zyisnKzw4Suh0iyoauBe5jU/edit?usp=sharing">Average health per star per wave</a></li>
    <li>Most attacks are typically +1 more in bot mode than alt mode; Tanks especially so</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Editorial</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>In text, a character card of “Name - Title” is referred to as “Name, Title”. </li>
    <li>Character titles are left justified. The name in Ancient Autobot is right aligned in the banner background. </li>
    <li>Star counts use 1-star, 5-star, and 10-star denominations. </li>
</ol>
</dd>
