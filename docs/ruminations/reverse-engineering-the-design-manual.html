<h1>Reverse Engineering the Design Book</h1>
<h3>2020.07.24</h3>

<p>One assumes that the WotC Design team had a long series of internal rules they used when designing. Themes for traits, algorithms for attack/health/defense, things they won't do. We need to build that. The following are some ideas towards that. </p>

<hr/>

<dt>Battle Icon Color Rules</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Outside of reprints; Only star cards get [OO], [UU], [OU], [BBB], and any triple battle icon card with [W]</li>
    <li>No quadruplet battle icon cards</li>
    <li>No [W][O] or [W][U] battle icon cards</li>
    <li>No [G][G] or [W][W]</li>
    <li>Battle Icon sort order is WOBUG</li>
    <li>A blue/black battle card is often a slightly weaker version of a blue battle card. It might be the same strength, but have an opposite-value effect on the target. For example, Scouting Mission does a damage to draw 2 cards, compared to various blue battle icon'd do 1 damage cards. The same is true for orange/black. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Trait Themes</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Cars typically have 'flip to' effects for alt-mode (18/45 Cars who are 6+ stars). They are about flipping and untapping. </li>
    <li>Planes are about moving damage. They have low defense. </li>
    <li>Dinobots are about Bold. Their alt-mode 'flip to' effects often help other Dinobots. </li>
    <li>Tanks have high defense (2-3). </li>
    <li>Leaders are Leaders in all modes. "Chromia, Special Ops"" is the exception, but that seems like an error. </li>
    <li>Motorcycles have the same attack in both modes. 3/4 have "flip to' effects for alt-mode. They have low star costs. </li>
    <li>4 out of 5 Boats are Specialists. </li>
    <li>Helicopters (Whirl/Alpha Bravo) defend well against Ranged/Planes. </li>
    <li>Trucks are jack of all trades. They sometimes start with cards (Ratchet/Trailbreaker/Ultra Magnus), they are sometimes Upgrade focused (Gears, Outback, Primes, Capt Ironhide, Sgt Kup)</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Upgrade Themes</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Weapons typically have from 0 to +4 attack. A +4 attack weapon is typically not repeatable (i.e. scraps)</li>
    <li>Armors typically have from 0 to +3 defense. A +3 defense armor is typically not repeatable (i.e. scraps)</li>
    <li>White/Green upgrades are most often Utilities. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Action Themes</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Many Actions are also found repeated as Character's abilities. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Statistics</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NcLXmDl2HfPrm2wyqlq3zyisnKzw4Suh0iyoauBe5jU/edit?usp=sharing">Average stats per star per wave</a></li>
    <li>Most attacks are typically +1 more in bot mode than alt mode; Tanks especially so. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Editorial</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>In text, a character card of “Name - Title” is referred to as “Name, Title”. </li>
    <li>Character titles are left justified. The name in Ancient Autobot is right aligned in the banner background. </li>
    <li>Star counts use 1-star, 5-star, and 10-star denominations. </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Star Costs</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
    <li>Do not reduce the star cost of a card, instead increase the size of the star pool (i.e. from 25 to something higher). Blaster and Soundwave are good examples. </li>
</ol>
</dd>
