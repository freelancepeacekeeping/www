<h1>Tidal Wave FAQ</h1>

<h3>WARNING: This is one interpretation. Much debate. </h3>

<p><b>Qn: When Tidal Wave (Carrier/Landing Craft) attacks and they deploy a character who gets an attack, must you use that attack or is it optional?</b></p>

<p>
If the deployed character is able to attack, they must attack.  [Though as far as I know, they will always be able to attack]<br/>
<br/>
<u>Details:</u><br/>
<br/>
The Expanded Rules section 4.3 says:<br/>
<br/>
'4.3. If the defending player has no untapped characters, and the attacking player has at least one untapped character, the attacking player gets an additional attack. The game returns to the “3. Attack” phase, above. The attacking player may receive multiple additional attacks this way during a turn. This is informally known as “attacking out.”  '<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to get extra attacks in the game, however the Expanded Rules do not call out these extra attacks specifically. However, reading between the lines, I deduce that the extra attacks happen during 4.3. I proposed it should be read as:<br/>
<br/>
'4.3. If a card effect has granted you extra attacks, or the defending player has no untapped characters and the attacking player has at least one untapped character (informally , known as “attacking out”), the attacking player gets an additional attack. The game returns to the “3. Attack” phase, above. The attacking player may receive multiple additional attacks this way during a turn. '<br/>
Note that 4.3 and 4.2 need to be swapped as 4.2 indicates that the turn is over if the opponent has untapped characters. <br/>
<br/>
The FAQ for Relentless Invasion seems to agree with that. It states that "the characters put onto the battlefield this way attack this turn". After attacking with each of the characters Relentless Invasion brings back, Trypticon (or other character) can optionally attack. This indicates that the Relentless Invasion attack(s) have consumed the first attack for the turn (Section 3 of the Expanded Rules), and that, per FAQ though not the card, an optional extra attack has been assigned for another character. <i>(This is a smell; how is Relentless Invasion gifting Trypticon an Optional Extra attack? Perhaps the FAQ is poorly written and Trypticon only gets to attack IF it attacks first; otherwise there is no justification for Trypticon getting an attack after the two minions have attacked)</i><br/>
<br/>
Pop a Wheelie and All-Out Attack are two other cards that relate to getting additional attacks. The interpretation and Relentless FAQ above have interesting effects for Pop a Wheelie.<br/>
<br/>
Pop a Wheelie states that "You get an extra attack this turn, but only a Motorcycle can attack this way". The above means that you must use this attack, if you can. There are ways in this case however where you would not be able to:<br/>
<br/>
* You might have played the card with no Motorcycle on the team.<br/>
* Your Motorcycles may have already all been tapped.<br/>
* You used your only available Motorcycle to make your first attack.<br/>
* You flipped your only Motorcycle back to bot mode.<br/>
<br/>
All-Out Attack states that "Each of your untapped Transformers can attack this turn". <br/>
<br/>
The FAQ for All-Out Attacks ( https://tftcg.info//wave-1/battle-cards/all-out-attack.html#Rules_Roundup-2019-09-06__5-10 ) indicates that this 'can attack this turn' language is optional. I caution too much interpretation on this however as All-Out Attack is an early card. It may be that the card should have simply said 'may attack this turn'.
